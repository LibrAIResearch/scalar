Current interpretability work can extract features\nfrom hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how\nMLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise\nnonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to\ntrace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear\nMLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity\nthat nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully\nexpressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing\nflexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights\nusing eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy\ntasks, image classification, and language modeling. We use this understanding\nto craft adversarial examples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language\nmodel circuits directly from the weights alone. Our results demonstrate that\nbilinear layers serve as an interpretable drop-in replacement for current\nactivation functions and that weight-based interpretability is viable for\nunderstanding deep-learning models.\n\n\n## 1 Introduction\nMulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are an important component of many deep learning models, including transformers (Vaswani et al., [2017]). Unfortunately, element-wise nonlinearities obscure the relationship between weights, inputs, and outputs, making it difficult to trace a neural network\u2019s decision-making process.\nConsequently, MLPs have previously been treated as undecomposable components in interpretability research (Elhage et al., [2021]).\n00footnotetext: Code at: [https://github.com/tdooms/bilinear-decomposition]\n\nWhile early mechanistic interpretability literature explored neural network weights (Olah et al., [2017]; [2020]); Voss et al., [2021]; Elhage et al., [2021]), activation-based approaches dominate contemporary research (Petsiuk et al., [2018]; Ribeiro et al., [2016]; Simonyan et al., [2014]; Montavon et al., [2018]). In particular, most recent studies on transformers use sparse dictionary learning (SDL) to decompose latent representations into an overcomplete basis of seemingly interpretable atoms\n(Cunningham et al., [2024]; Bricken et al., [2023b]; Marks et al., [2024]; Dunefsky et al., [2024]).\nHowever, SDL-based approaches only describe which features are present, not how they are formed or what their downstream effect is.\nPrevious work has approximated interactions between latent dictionaries using linear and gradient-based attribution (Marks et al., [2024]; Ge et al., [2024]), but these approaches offer weak guarantees of generalization. To ensure faithfulness, ideally, we would be able to capture nonlinear feature interactions in circuits that are grounded in the model weights.\n\nOne path to better circuit discovery is to use more inherently interpretable architectures. Previous work constrains the model into using human-understandable components or concepts (Koh et al., [2020]; Chen et al., [2019]), but this typically requires labeled training data for the predefined concepts and involves a trade-off in accuracy compared to learning the best concepts for performance (Henighan et al., [2023]). Ideally, we could more easily extract and interpret the concepts that models naturally learn rather than force the model to use particular concepts. To this end, Sharkey ( [2023])) suggested that bilinear layers of the form g\u200b(\ud835\udc99)=(\ud835\udc7e\u200b\ud835\udc99)\u2299(\ud835\udc7d\u200b\ud835\udc99)\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc99direct-product\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc7d\ud835\udc99g({\\\\bm{x}})=({\\\\bm{W}}{\\\\bm{x}})\\\\odot({\\\\bm{V}}{\\\\bm{x}}) are intrinsically interpretable because their computations can be expressed in terms of linear operations with a third order tensor. This enables the use of tensor or matrix decompositions to understand the weights. Moreover, bilinear layers outperform ReLU-based transformers in language modeling (Shazeer, [2020]) and have performance only slightly below SwiGLU, which is prevalent in competitive models today (Touvron et al., [2023]).\n\nWe show that bilinear MLPs can be decomposed into functionally relevant, interpretable components by directly decomposing the weights, without using inputs. These decompositions reveal a low-rank structure in bilinear MLPs trained across various tasks. In summary, this paper demonstrates that bilinear MLPs are an interpretable drop-in replacement for ordinary MLPs in a wide range of settings. Our contributions are as follows:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nIn [section 3]Analysis methods \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), we introduce several methods to analyze bilinear MLPs. One method decomposes the weights into a set of eigenvectors that explain the outputs along a given set of directions in a way that is fully equivalent to the layer\u2019s original computations.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nIn [section 4]Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), we showcase the eigenvector decomposition across multiple image classification tasks, revealing an interpretable low-rank structure. Smaller eigenvalue terms can be truncated while preserving performance. Using the eigenvectors, we see how regularization reduces signs of overfitting in the extracted features and construct adversarial examples.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nFinally, in [section 5]Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), we analyze how bilinear MLPs compute output features from input features, both derived from sparse dictionary learning (SDL). We highlight a small circuit that flips the sentiment of the next token if the current token is a negation (\u201cnot\u201d). We also find that many output features are well-correlated with low-rank approximations. This gives evidence that weight-based interpretability can be viable in large language models.\n\n## 2 Background\nThroughout, we use conventional notation as in Goodfellow et al. ( [2016]). Scalars are denoted by s\ud835\udc60s, vectors by \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc97{\\\\bm{v}}, matrices by \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc74{\\\\bm{M}}, and third-order tensors by \ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc7b{\\\\bm{\\\\mathsfit{T}}}. The entry in row i\ud835\udc56i and column j\ud835\udc57j of a matrix \ud835\udc74\ud835\udc74{\\\\bm{M}} is a scalar and therefore denoted as mi\u200bjsubscript\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57m\\_{ij}. We denote taking row i\ud835\udc56i or column j\ud835\udc57j of a matrix by \ud835\udc8ei:subscript\ud835\udc8e:\ud835\udc56absent{\\\\bm{m}}\\_{i:} and \ud835\udc8e:jsubscript\ud835\udc8e:absent\ud835\udc57{\\\\bm{m}}\\_{:j} respectively. We use \u2299direct-product\\\\odot to denote an element-wise product and \u22c5axissubscript\u22c5axis\\\\cdot\\_{\\\\text{axis}} to denote a product of tensors along the specified axis.\n\nDefining bilinear MLPs.\nModern Transformers (Touvron et al., [2023]) feature Gated Linear Units (GLUs), which offer a performance gain over standard MLPs for the same number of parameters (Shazeer, [2020]). GLU activations consist of the component-wise product of two linear up-projections, \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e{\\\\bm{W}} and \ud835\udc7d\ud835\udc7d{\\\\bm{V}}, one of which is passed through a nonlinear activation function \u03c3\ud835\udf0e\\\\sigma( [Equation 1]Background \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). We omit biases for brevity.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | g\u200b(\ud835\udc99)\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc99\\\\displaystyle g({\\\\bm{x}}) | =(\ud835\udc7e\u200b\ud835\udc99)\u2299\u03c3\u200b(\ud835\udc7d\u200b\ud835\udc99)absentdirect-product\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc99\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc7d\ud835\udc99\\\\displaystyle=({\\\\bm{W}}{\\\\bm{x}})\\\\odot\\\\sigma({\\\\bm{V}}{\\\\bm{x}}) |  | (1) |\n|  | GLU\u200b(\ud835\udc99)GLU\ud835\udc99\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{GLU}({\\\\bm{x}}) | =\ud835\udc77\u200b(g\u200b(\ud835\udc99))absent\ud835\udc77\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc99\\\\displaystyle={\\\\bm{P}}(g({\\\\bm{x}})) |  |\n\nA bilinear layer is a GLU variant that omits the nonlinear activation function \u03c3\ud835\udf0e\\\\sigma. Bilinear layers beat ordinary ReLU MLPs, and perform almost as well as SwiGLU on language modeling tasks (Shazeer, [2020]). We corroborate these findings in [Appendix G]Appendix G Bilinear transformers: a loss comparison \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), and show that bilinear layers achieve equal loss when keeping training time constant and marginally worse loss when keeping data constant.\n\nInteraction matrices and the bilinear tensor. A bilinear MLP parameterizes the pairwise interactions between inputs.

B) Diagram of the eigendecomposition technique. Multiplying the bilinear tensor by a desired output direction \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc96{\\\\bm{u}} produces an interaction matrix \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc78{\\\\bm{Q}} that can be decomposed into a set of eigenvectors \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc97{\\\\bm{v}} and associated eigenvalues \u03bbi.subscript\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56\\\\lambda\\_{i}.\n\nGiven a set of meaningful features for the MLP outputs, we can identify the most important input directions that determine the output feature activations. The output features could come from a sparse autoencoder, from the unembedding layer (demonstrated in [section 4]Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")), or from a previous decompilation of the later layers.\n\nThe interaction matrix, \ud835\udc78=\ud835\udc96\u22c5out\ud835\udc69\ud835\udc78subscript\u22c5out\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc69{\\\\bm{Q}}={\\\\bm{u}}\\\\cdot\\_{\\\\text{out}}{\\\\bm{\\\\mathsfit{B}}} for a given output feature \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc96{\\\\bm{u}} can be decomposed into a set of eigenvectors ( [Figure 1]Figure 1 \u2023 3.2 Output features \u2192 eigendecomposition \u2023 3 Analysis methods \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). Since \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc78{\\\\bm{Q}} can be considered symmetric without loss of generality (see [section 2]Background \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")), the spectral theorem gives\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | \ud835\udc78=\u2211id\u03bbi\u200b\ud835\udc97i\u200b\ud835\udc97iT\ud835\udc78superscriptsubscript\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51subscript\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56subscript\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc56superscriptsubscript\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc47\\\\displaystyle{\\\\bm{Q}}=\\\\sum\\_{i}^{d}\\\\lambda\\_{i}\\ {\\\\bm{v}}\\_{i}{\\\\bm{v}}\\_{i}^{T} |  | (2) |\n\nwith a set of d\ud835\udc51d (rank of \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e{\\\\bm{W}}, \ud835\udc7d\ud835\udc7d{\\\\bm{V}}) orthonormal eigenvectors \ud835\udc97isubscript\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc56{\\\\bm{v}}\\_{i} and real-valued eigenvalues \u03bbisubscript\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56\\\\lambda\\_{i}.

The top eigenvectors by eigenvalue magnitude give the best low-rank approximation to the interaction matrix \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc78{\\\\bm{Q}} for a given rank. And since the eigenvectors diagonalize \ud835\udc78\ud835\udc78{\\\\bm{Q}}, there are no cross-interactions between eigenvectors that would complicate the interpretation of their contributions to \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc96{\\\\bm{u}}.\n\n### 3.3 No features \u2192\u2192\\\\rightarrow higher-order SVD\n\nIf we have no prior features available, it is still possible to determine the most important input and output directions of \ud835\udc69\ud835\udc69{\\\\bm{\\\\mathsfit{B}}} through a higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). The simplest approach that takes advantage of the symmetry in \ud835\udc69\ud835\udc69{\\\\bm{\\\\mathsfit{B}}} is to reshape the tensor by flattening the two input dimensions to produce a dout\u00d7din2subscript\ud835\udc51outsuperscriptsubscript\ud835\udc51in2d\\_{\\\\text{out}}\\\\times d\\_{\\\\text{in}}^{2} shaped matrix and then do a standard singular value decomposition (SVD).\nSchematically, this gives\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | \ud835\udc69out,in\u00d7in=\u2211i\u03c3i\u200b\ud835\udc96out(i)\u2297\ud835\udc92in\u00d7in(i)subscript\ud835\udc69outininsubscript\ud835\udc56tensor-productsubscript\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56subscriptsuperscript\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc56outsubscriptsuperscript\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc56inin\\\\displaystyle{\\\\bm{B}}\\_{\\\\text{out},\\\\text{in}\\\\times\\\\text{in}}=\\\\sum\\_{i}\\\\sigma\\_{i}\\ {\\\\bm{u}}^{(i)}\\_{\\\\text{out}}\\\\otimes{\\\\bm{q}}^{(i)}\\_{\\\\text{in}\\\\times\\\\text{in}} |  |\n\nwhere \ud835\udc92\ud835\udc92{\\\\bm{q}} can still be treated as an interaction matrix and further decomposed into eigenvectors as described above.\n\n## 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features\nWe consider models trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and the Fashion-MNIST dataset of clothing images. This is a semi-controlled environment that allows us to evaluate the interpretability of eigenvectors on a nontrivial task. This section analyses a shallow feedforward network (FFN) consisting of an embedding projection, a bilinear layer, and a classification head; see [Appendix F]Appendix F Experimental setups: a detailed description \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") for details.\n\nFirst, we qualitatively survey the eigenvectors and highlight the importance of regularization in feature quality. Second, we consider the consistency of eigenvectors across training runs and sizes. Third, we turn toward an algorithmic task on MNIST, where we compare the ground truth with the extracted eigenvectors. Lastly, we use these eigenvectors to construct adversarial examples, demonstrating their causal importance.\n\n### 4.1 Qualitative assessment: top eigenvectors appear interpretable\n\nThe eigenvectors are derived using the unembedding directions for the digits to obtain interaction matrices that are then decomposed following [subsection 3.2]Output features \u2192 eigendecomposition \u2023 3 Analysis methods \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"). We can visualize them by projecting them into the input space using the embedding weights. Because the activation of an eigenvector \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc97{\\\\bm{v}} with eigenvalue \u03bbisubscript\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56\\\\lambda\\_{i} is quadratic in the input, \u03bb\u200b(\ud835\udc97T\u200b\ud835\udc99)2\ud835\udf06superscriptsuperscript\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc992\\\\lambda({\\\\bm{v}}^{T}{\\\\bm{x}})^{2}, the sign of the eigenvector \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc97{\\\\bm{v}} is arbitrary. The quadratic leads to XOR-like behavior where high overlap with an eigenvector\u2019s positive regions (blue) _or_ the negative regions (red)\u2014but not both\u2014leads to large activation magnitude, while the overall sign is determined by the eigenvalue ( [Figure 2]Figure 2 \u2023 4.1 Qualitative assessment: top eigenvectors appear interpretable \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") A).\n\nFor MNIST, the top positive eigenvector for each output class emphasizes a curve segment specific to its digit or otherwise resembles a prototypical class image ( [Figure 2]Figure 2 \u2023 4.1 Qualitative assessment: top eigenvectors appear interpretable \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") B). Top eigenvectors for FMNIST function as edge detectors, focusing on important edges for each clothing article, such as the leg gap for trousers. Edge detecting relies on the XOR-like behavior of the eigenvector\u2019s quadratic activation.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)\n\n![Refer to caption](b)\n\nFigure 2: A) Eigenvector activations are quadratic in the input and have a large magnitude if an input aligns with the positive (blue) regions _or_ the negative (red) regions, but not both. B) Top eigenvectors for single-layer MNIST and Fashion-MNIST models, revealing the most significant patterns learned for each class. In MNIST, eigenvectors represent components of the target class, while Fashion-MNIST eigenvectors function as edge detectors. Best viewed in color.![Refer to caption]Figure 3: The top four positive (top) and negative (bottom) eigenvectors for the digit 5, ordered from left to right by importance. Their eigenvalues are highlighted on the left. Only 20 positive and 20 negative eigenvalues (out of 512) are shown on the left images. Eigenvectors tend to represent semantically and spatially coherent structures.\n\nOnly a small fraction of eigenvalues have non-negligible magnitude ( [Figure 3]Figure 3 \u2023 4.1 Qualitative assessment: top eigenvectors appear interpretable \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). Different top eigenvectors capture semantically different aspects of the class. For example, in the spectrum for digit 5, the first two positive eigenvectors detect the 5\u2019s horizontal top stroke but at different positions, similar to Gabor filters. The next two positive eigenvectors detect the bottom segment. The negative eigenvectors are somewhat less intuitive but generally correspond to features that indicate the digit is not a five, such as an upward curve in the top right quadrant instead of a horizontal stroke. In [Appendix C]Appendix C Explainability: a small case study with eigenvectors \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), we study this technique towards explaining an input prediction. Details of the training setup are outlined in [Appendix F]Appendix F Experimental setups: a detailed description \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") while similar plots for other digits can be found in [Appendix A]Appendix A Eigenspectra: showing eigenvectors across digits \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\").\n\nBecause we can extract features directly from model weights, we can identify overfitting in image models by visualizing the top eigenvectors and searching for spatial artifacts.\nFor instance, the eigenvectors of unregularized models focus on certain outlying pixels ( [Figure 4]Figure 4 \u2023 4.1 Qualitative assessment: top eigenvectors appear interpretable \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")).\nWe found adding dense Gaussian noise to the inputs (Bricken et al., [2023a]) to be an effective model regularizer, producing bilinear layers with more intuitively interpretable features.\nIncreasing the scale of the added noise results produces more digit-like eigenvectors and results in a lower-rank eigenvalue spectrum ( [Appendix D]Appendix D Sparsity: weight decay versus input noise \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")).\nThese results indicate that our technique can qualitatively help uncover overfitting or other unwanted behavior in models.\nFurthermore, it can be used to evaluate the effect of certain regularizers and augmentation techniques, as explored in [Appendix B]Appendix B Regularization & augmentation: ablations & observations \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\").\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Top eigenvector for models trained with varying Gaussian input noise. For reference, the norm of an average digit is about 0.3; adding noise with a norm of 1 results in a heavily distorted but discernible digit. Finally, the test accuracy for each model is shown at the top.\n\n### 4.2 Quantitative assessment: eigenvectors learn consistent patterns\n\nOne important question in machine learning is whether models learn the same structure across training runs (Li et al., [2016]) and across model sizes (Frankle & Carbin, [2019]). In this section, we study both and find that eigenvectors are similar across runs and behave similarly across model sizes. Furthermore, we characterize the impact of eigenvector truncation on classification accuracy.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)\n\n![Refer to caption](b)\n\nFigure 5: A) The similarity between ordered eigenvectors of the same model size averaged over all digits. This shows that equally sized models learn similar features. B) Resulting accuracy after only retaining the n\ud835\udc5bn most important eigenvalues (per digit). Both plots are averaged over 5 runs with the 90% confidence interval shown.\n\nBoth the ordering and contents of top eigenvectors are very consistent across runs. The cosine similarities of the top eigenvector are between 0.8 and 0.9 depending on size ( [Figure 5]Figure 5 \u2023 4.2 Quantitative assessment: eigenvectors learn consistent patterns \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). Generally, increasing model sizes results in more similar top eigenvectors. Further, truncating all but the top few eigenvectors across model sizes yields very similar classification accuracy. This implies that, beyond being consistently similar, these eigenvectors have a comparable impact on classification. In [Appendix E]Appendix E Truncation & similarity: a comparison across sizes \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), we further study the similarity of eigenvectors between sizes and show that retaining only a handful of eigenvectors results in minimal accuracy drops (0.01%).\n\n### 4.3 Comparing with ground truth: eigenvectors find computation\n\nTo perform a ground-truth assessment of eigenvectors, we consider a task from a mechanistic interpretability challenge, where the goal was to determine the labeling function (training objective) from a model Casper ( [2023])). Specifically, the challenge required reverse-engineering a binary image classifier trained on MNIST, where the label is based on the similarity to a specific target image. The model predicted \u2018True\u2019 if the input has high cosine similarity to this target or high similarity to the complement of that target 111By complement, we mean one minus the grayscale value of the target. and \u2018False\u2019 otherwise. This target is chosen as an instance of a \u20181\u2019.\n\nPrevious work (Stefan Heimersheim, [2023]) reverse-engineered this through a combination of methods, all requiring careful consideration and consisting of non-trivial insights. Furthermore, the methods required knowledge of the original dataset and a hint of what to look for. While our method does not work on the original architecture, we show that we do not require such knowledge and can extract the original algorithm from the weights alone.\n\nWe perform our decomposition on the output difference (True\u2212FalseTrueFalse\\\\text{True}-\\\\text{False}) since this is the only meaningful direction before the softmax. This consistently reveals one high positive eigenvalue; the rest are (close to) zero ( [Figure 6]Figure 6 \u2023 4.3 Comparing with ground truth: eigenvectors find computation \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). The most positive eigenvector is sufficient for completing the task; it computes the exact similarity we want. If the input is close to the target, the blue region will match; if it is close to the complement, the red will match; if both are active simultaneously, they will somewhat cancel out. The remaining two eigenvectors are separated as they seem to overfit the data slightly; the negative eigenvector seems to penalize diagonal structures.\n\nContrary to other models, this task greatly benefited from including biases. This arises from the fact that the model must not only compute similarity but also make its binary decision based on a learned threshold. If no bias is provided, the model attempts to find quadratic invariances in the data, which don\u2019t generalize well, especially given the important but sensitive role of this threshold in classification. Here, the bias (shown in the bottom corner of [Figure 6]Figure 6 \u2023 4.3 Comparing with ground truth: eigenvectors find computation \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")) represents a negative contribution. The role of biases in bilinear layers is further discussed in [Appendix J]Appendix J Bilinear layers: a practical guide \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\").\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 6: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a model trained to classify based on similarity to a target. The most important eigenvector (top-left) is a generalizing solution; the other features sharpen the decision boundary based on the training dataset. The latter features disappear with increased regularization. On the right, the target digit is shown along with the learned bias from the model.\n\n### 4.4 Adversarial masks: general attacks from weights\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of weight-based decomposition, we construct adversarial masks for the MNIST model without training or any forward passes. These masks are added to the input, leading to misclassification as the adversarial digit. The effect is similar to steering, but the intervention is at the input instead of the model internals.\n\nWe construct the adversarial masks from the eigenvectors for specific digits. One complication is that the eigenvectors can have nontrivial cosine similarity with each other, so an input along a single eigenvector direction could potentially activate multiple eigenvectors across different digits. To help avoid this, we construct the mask \ud835\udc8eisubscript\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc56{\\\\bm{m}}\\_{i} for a given eigenvector \ud835\udc97i:subscript\ud835\udc97:\ud835\udc56absent{\\\\bm{v}}\\_{i:} as the corresponding row of the pseudoinverse (\ud835\udc7d+)i:subscriptsuperscript\ud835\udc7d:\ud835\udc56absent({\\\\bm{V}}^{+})\\_{i:} for a set of eigenvectors \ud835\udc7d\ud835\udc7d{\\\\bm{V}} (specifically the top 10 positive). In an analogy to key-value pairs, the pseudoinverses effectively act like keys that activate with more specificity than the eigenvectors themselves, since \ud835\udc97j:\u22c5(\ud835\udc7d+)i:=\u03b4i\u200bj\u22c5subscript\ud835\udc97:\ud835\udc57absentsubscriptsuperscript\ud835\udc7d:\ud835\udc56absentsubscript\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57{\\\\bm{v}}\\_{j:}\\\\cdot({\\\\bm{V}}^{+})\\_{i:}=\\\\delta\\_{ij}.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 7: Examples of an adversarial mask constructed from the given eigenvector along for models trained A) with Gaussian noise regularization (std 0.15) and B) without regularization. The average accuracy and the rate of misclassification as the adversarial digit show stronger effects for adversarial masks than random baselines. In B), the mask is only applied to the outer edge of pixels that are active on less than 1% of samples.\n\nWe construct an adversarial mask from an eigenvector for the digit 3 ( [Figure 7]Figure 7 \u2023 4.4 Adversarial masks: general attacks from weights \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") A). Even though the original eigenvector resembles the digit, the pseudoinverse-based mask does not (see [Appendix K]Appendix K Adversarial masks: additional figure \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") for more examples). The accuracy, averaged over masks from the top three eigenvectors, drops significantly more than the baseline of randomly permuting the mask, despite regularizing the model during training using dense Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.15. The corresponding rise in misclassification indicates effective steering towards the adversarial digit.\n\n**[MASKED_CITATION]**) observe that adversarial examples can arise from predictive but non-robust features of the data, perhaps explaining why they often transfer to other models. Our construction can be seen as a toy realization of this phenomenon because the masks correspond to directions that are predictive of robust features but are not robust. We construct masks that only exploit the patterns of over-fitting found on the outer edge of the image for a model trained without regularization ( [Figure 7]Figure 7 \u2023 4.4 Adversarial masks: general attacks from weights \u2023 4 Image classification: interpreting visual features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") B). Since we can find this over-fitting pattern from the eigenvectors, in a general way, we can construct the mask by hand instead of optimizing it.\n\n## 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features\nEach output of a bilinear layer is described by weighted pairwise interactions between their input features. Previous sections show that this can be successfully leveraged to trace between a bilinear layer\u2019s inputs and outputs. Here, we turn towards tracing between latent feature dictionaries obtained by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the MLP inputs or outputs for a 6-layer bilinear transformer trained on TinyStories (Eldan & Li, [2023]) (see training details in [Appendix F]Appendix F Experimental setups: a detailed description \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")).\n\n### 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit\n\nWe focus on using the eigendecomposition to identify low-rank, single-layer circuits in a bilinear transformer. We cherry-pick and discuss one such circuit that takes input sentiment features and semantically negates them. Unlike previous work on sparse feature circuits (Marks et al., [2024]) that relies on gradient-based linear approximations, we identify nonlinear interactions grounded in the layer\u2019s weights that contribute to the circuit\u2019s computation.\n\nThe sentiment negation circuit computes the activation of two opposing output features in layer 4 (index 1882 and 1179) that form a fully linear subspace. The cosine similarity of their decoder vectors is -0.975. Based on their top activations, the output features activate on negation tokens (\u201cnot\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d, \u201cwasn\u2019t\u201d) and boosts either positive sentiment tokens (\u201cgood\u201d, \u201csafe\u201d, \u201cnice\u201d) or negative sentiment tokens (\u201cbad\u201d, \u201churt\u201d, \u201csad\u201d), so we denote the two features as the _not-good_ and the _not-bad_ features respectively. See [Appendix M]Appendix M Input features of the negation feature \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") for the top activations of all features mentioned.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 8: The sentiment negation circuit for computing the not-good and not-bad output features. A) The interaction submatrix containing the top 15 interactions. B) The top interacting features projected onto the top positive and negative eigenvectors using cosine similarity, with the symbols for different clusters matching the labels in A. Clusters coincide with the projection of meaningful directions such as the difference in \u201cbad\u201d vs \u201cgood\u201d token unembeddings and the MLP\u2019s input activations for input tokens \u201c\\[BOS\\] not\u201d. C) The not-good feature activation compared to its approximation by the top two eigenvectors.\n\nFocusing on the not-good feature, the top interactions for computing its activations resemble an AND-gate ( [Figure 8]Figure 8 \u2023 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit \u2023 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") A). Input features that boost negative sentiment tokens (blue squares) have strong positive interactions with negation token features (green triangles), but both have negligible self-interactions. So both types of input features are needed to activate the not-good feature and flip the boosting from negative to positive sentiment. The one positive sentiment feature (orange downward triangle) has interactions with the opposite sign. The interactions shown are significantly larger than the typical cross-interactions with a standard deviation of 0.004 ( [Figure 24]Figure 24 \u2023 Appendix L Language: further details for feature circuits \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\").\n\nThe eigenvalue spectrum has one large positive (0.62) and one large negative value (-0.66) as outliers ( [Figure 24]Figure 24 \u2023 Appendix L Language: further details for feature circuits \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). We can see the underlying geometry of the circuit computation by projecting the input features onto these eigenvectors ( [Figure 8]Figure 8 \u2023 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit \u2023 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\")). By itself, a positive sentiment feature (blue squares) would equally activate both eigenvectors and cancel out, but if a negation feature is also present, the positive eigenvector is strongly activated. The activation based on only these two eigenvectors, following [Equation 3]Output features \u2192 eigendecomposition \u2023 3 Analysis methods \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"), has a good correlation (0.66) with the activation of the not-good feature, particularly at large activation values (0.76), conditioned on the not-good feature being active.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 9: Activation correlations with low-rank approximations. A) Average correlation over output features computed over all inputs before the SAE\u2019s non-linearity (TopK) is applied or only on inputs where the feature is active.

Approximations use the top two eigenvectors.\n\n### 5.2 Low-rank approximations of output feature activations\n\nThe top eigenvectors can be used to approximate the activations of the SAE output features using a truncated form of [Equation 3]Output features \u2192 eigendecomposition \u2023 3 Analysis methods \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\"). To focus on the more meaningful tail of large activations, we compute the approximation\u2019s correlation conditioned on the output feature being active. For comparison, we also compute the approximation\u2019s correlation with the output feature activations before the SAE\u2019s nonlinearity (TopK) is applied. These correlations are generally lower because they are dominated by inputs with low activations.\n\nWe find that features are surprisingly low-rank, with the average active-only correlation starting at 0.67 for approximations by a single eigenvector and rising steadily with additional eigenvectors ( [Figure 9]Figure 9 \u2023 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit \u2023 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") A). Most features (69%) have a high correlation (>0.75absent0.75>0.75) even when approximated by just two eigenvectors ( [Figure 9]Figure 9 \u2023 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit \u2023 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") B). Scatter plots for a random sample of features show that the low-rank approximation often captures the tail dependence well ( [Figure 9]Figure 9 \u2023 5.1 Sentiment negation circuit \u2023 5 Language: finding interactions between SAE features \u2023 Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability\") C). Overall these results suggest that the interactions that produce large output activations are low-rank, making their interpretability potentially easier.\n\n## 6 Discussion\nSummary.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to weight-based interpretability that leverages the close-to-linear structure of bilinear layers. A key result is that, using an eigenvector decomposition, we can identify the most important input directions that explain the layer\u2019s output along a given direction. The top eigenvectors are often interpretable, for example for MNIST they function as edge-detectors for strokes specific to each digit. The lack of element-wise nonlinearity in bilinear MLPs allows us to transform their weights into interaction matrices that connect input to output features and then extract the low-rank structure. In language models, we find that many SAE output features are well-approximated by low-rank interaction matrices, particularly at large activations. We highlighted one example of an extracted low-rank circuit that flips the sentiment of the next token if the current token is a negation (\u201cnot\u201d). The behavior of this circuit can be easily understood in terms of the top eigenvectors, whereas finding a similar circuit in conventional MLPs would be more difficult. Overall, our results demonstrate that bilinear MLPs offer intrinsic interpretability that can aid in feature and circuit extraction.\n\nImplications.\nThe main implication of our work is that weight-based interpretability is viable, even for large language models. Bilinear MLPs can replace conventional MLPs in transformers with minimal cost while offering intrinsic interpretability due to their lack of element-wise nonlinearities and close-to-linear structure.\nCurrent circuit analysis techniques rely on gradient-based approximations (Syed et al., [2023]; Marks et al., [2024]) or use transcoders (Dunefsky et al., [2024]) to approximate MLPs. Both approaches depend on an input dataset, potentially leading to poor performance out-of-distribution, and they may not fully capture the nonlinear computations in MLPs. In contrast, bilinear MLPs can be transformed into explicit feature interaction matrices and decomposed in a way fully equivalent to the original computations. Extracting interactions more directly from the weights should lead to better, more robust circuits. Weight-based interpretability may also offer better safety guarantees since we could plausibly prove bounds on a layer\u2019s outputs based by quantifying the residual weights not captured in a circuit\u2019s interactions.\n\nLimitations. Application of our methods typically relies on having a set of meaningful output directions available. In shallow models, the unembedding directions can be used, but in deeper models, we rely on features derived from sparse autoencoders that are dependent on an input dataset. Another limitation is that, although the eigenvalue spectra are often low-rank and the top eigenvectors appear interpretable, there are no guarantees the eigenvectors will be monosemantic. We expect that for high-rank spectra, the orthogonality between eigenvectors may limit their interpretability. Applying sparse dictionary learning approaches to decompose the bilinear tensor may be a promising way to relax the orthogonality constraint and find interpretable features from model weights.</Paper>\n\n<References>\n<Candidate>Candidate [0]:\nThe lottery ticket hypothesis: Finding sparse, trainable neural networks, 2019.\n\n<Abstract>Abstract: Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained\nnetworks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving\ncomputational performance of inference without compromising accuracy.

We\nidentify a winning ticket by training a network and pruning its smallest-magnitude weights.\nThe remaining, unpruned connections constitute\nthe architecture of the winning ticket. Unique to our work, each unpruned connection\u2019s value is then reset to\nits initialization from original network _before_ it was trained.\nThis forms our central experiment:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nRandomly initialize a neural network f\u200b(x;\u03b80)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc65subscript\ud835\udf030f(x;\\\\theta\\_{0}) (where \u03b80\u223c\ud835\udc9f\u03b8similar-tosubscript\ud835\udf030subscript\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udf03\\\\theta\\_{0}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\\\theta}).\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nTrain the network for j\ud835\udc57j iterations, arriving at parameters \u03b8jsubscript\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc57\\\\theta\\_{j}.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nPrune p%percent\ud835\udc5dp\\\\% of the parameters in \u03b8jsubscript\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc57\\\\theta\\_{j}, creating a mask m\ud835\udc5am.\n\n4. 4.\n\n\nReset the remaining parameters to their values in \u03b80subscript\ud835\udf030\\\\theta\\_{0}, creating the winning ticket f\u200b(x;m\u2299\u03b80)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc65direct-product\ud835\udc5asubscript\ud835\udf030f(x;m\\\\odot\\\\theta\\_{0}).\n\n\nAs described, this pruning approach is _one-shot_: the network is trained\nonce, p%percent\ud835\udc5dp\\\\% of weights are pruned, and the surviving weights are reset. However, in this paper, we focus on _iterative pruning_, which repeatedly\ntrains, prunes, and resets the network over n\ud835\udc5bn rounds; each round prunes p1n%percentsuperscript\ud835\udc5d1\ud835\udc5bp^{\\\\frac{1}{n}}\\\\% of the weights that survive the previous round.\nOur results show that iterative pruning finds winning tickets that match the accuracy of the original network at smaller sizes than does one-shot pruning.\n\nResults. We identify winning tickets in a fully-connected\narchitecture for MNIST and convolutional architectures for CIFAR10 across several optimization strategies (SGD, momentum, and Adam) with\ntechniques like dropout, weight decay, batchnorm, and residual connections. We use an unstructured pruning technique, so these winning tickets are sparse.\nIn deeper networks, our pruning-based strategy for finding winning tickets is sensitive to\nthe learning rate: it requires warmup to find winning tickets at higher learning rates.\nThe winning tickets we find are 10-20% (or less) of the size of the original network ( _smaller size_).\nDown to that size,\nthey meet or exceed the original network\u2019s test accuracy ( _commensurate accuracy_) in at most the same number of iterations ( _commensurate training time_).\nWhen randomly reinitialized, winning tickets\nperform far worse, meaning structure alone cannot explain a winning ticket\u2019s success.\n\nThe Lottery Ticket Conjecture. Returning to our motivating question, we\nextend our hypothesis into an untested conjecture that\nSGD seeks out and trains a subset of well-initialized weights.\nDense, randomly-initialized networks are easier to train than the sparse networks that result from pruning because\nthere are more possible subnetworks from which training might recover a winning ticket.\n\nContributions.\n\n- \u2022\n\n\nWe demonstrate that pruning uncovers trainable subnetworks that reach test accuracy comparable to the original\nnetworks from which they derived in a comparable number of iterations.\n\n- \u2022\n\n\nWe show that pruning finds winning tickets that learn faster than the original network while reaching higher test accuracy and generalizing better.\n\n- \u2022\n\n\nWe propose the _lottery ticket hypothesis_ as a new perspective on the composition of neural networks to explain these findings.\n\n\nImplications. In this paper, we empirically study the lottery ticket hypothesis. Now that we have demonstrated the existence of winning tickets, we hope to exploit this knowledge to:\n\nImprove training performance. Since winning tickets can be trained from the start in isolation, a hope is that we can design training schemes that search for winning tickets and prune as early as possible.\n\nDesign better networks. Winning tickets reveal combinations of sparse architectures and initializations that are particularly adept at learning. We can take\ninspiration from winning tickets to design new architectures and initialization schemes with the same properties that are conducive to learning. We may even be able to transfer\nwinning tickets discovered for one task to many others.\n\nImprove our theoretical understanding of neural networks. We can study why randomly-initialized feed-forward\nnetworks seem to contain winning tickets and potential implications for theoretical study of\noptimization (Du et al., [2019])) and generalization (Zhou et al., [2018]); Arora et al., [2018])).\n\n## 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks\n| Network | Lenet | Conv-2 | Conv-4 | Conv-6 | Resnet-18 | VGG-19 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Convolutions |  | 64, 64, pool | 64, 64, pool128, 128, pool | 64, 64, pool128, 128, pool256, 256, pool | 16, 3x\\[16, 16\\]3x\\[32, 32\\]3x\\[64, 64\\] | 2x64 pool 2x128pool, 4x256, pool4x512, pool, 4x512 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FC Layers | 300, 100, 10 | 256, 256, 10 | 256, 256, 10 | 256, 256, 10 | avg-pool, 10 | avg-pool, 10 |\n| All/Conv Weights | 266K | 4.3M / 38K | 2.4M / 260K | 1.7M / 1.1M | 274K / 270K | 20.0M |\n| Iterations/Batch | 50K / 60 | 20K / 60 | 25K / 60 | 30K / 60 | 30K / 128 | 112K / 64 |\n| Optimizer | Adam 1.2e-3 | Adam 2e-4 | Adam 3e-4 | Adam 3e-4 | \u2190\u2190\\\\leftarrow SGD 0.1-0.01-0.001 Momentum 0.9 \u2192\u2192\\\\rightarrow |\n| Pruning Rate | fc20% | conv10% fc20% | conv10% fc20% | conv15% fc20% | conv20% fc0% | conv20% fc0% |\n\nFigure 2: Architectures tested in this paper.\nConvolutions are 3x3.

( [2015]))). Connections\nto outputs are pruned at half of the rate of the rest of the network. We explore other hyperparameters in\nAppendix [G]Appendix G Hyperparameter Exploration for Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), including learning rates, optimization strategies (SGD, momentum), initialization schemes, and\nnetwork sizes.\n\nNotation.Pm=\u2225m\u22250\\|\u03b8\\|subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5asubscriptdelimited-\u2225\u2225\ud835\udc5a0\ud835\udf03P\\_{m}=\\\\frac{\\\\lVert m\\\\rVert\\_{0}}{\\|\\\\theta\\|} is the sparsity of mask m\ud835\udc5am, e.g.,\nPm=25%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent25P\\_{m}=25\\\\% when 75% of weights are pruned.\n\nIterative pruning.\nThe winning tickets we find learn faster than the original network.\nFigure\n[3]Figure 3 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") plots the average test accuracy when training winning tickets\niteratively pruned to various\nextents.

A similar\npattern repeats throughout this paper.\n\nFigure [4]Figure 4 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") a summarizes this behavior for all pruning levels when iteratively pruning by 20% per iteration (blue).\nOn the left is the iteration at which each network reaches minimum validation loss (i.e., when the early-stopping criterion would halt training)\nin relation to the percent of weights remaining after pruning; in the middle is test accuracy at that iteration.

However, at iteration 50,000 (Figure [4]Figure 4 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") b),\niteratively-pruned winning tickets still see a test accuracy improvement of up to 0.35 percentage points in spite of the fact that\ntraining accuracy reaches 100% for nearly all networks (Appendix [D]Appendix D Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), Figure [12]Figure 12 \u2023 Appendix D Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")). This means that the gap between\ntraining accuracy and test accuracy is smaller for winning tickets, pointing to improved generalization.\n\nRandom reinitialization. To measure the importance of a winning ticket\u2019s\ninitialization, we retain the structure of a winning ticket (i.e., the mask m\ud835\udc5am) but randomly sample a new initialization \u03b80\u2032\u223c\ud835\udc9f\u03b8similar-tosubscriptsuperscript\ud835\udf03\u20320subscript\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udf03\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{0}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{D}\\_{\\\\theta}.\nWe randomly reinitialize each winning ticket three times, making 15 total per point in Figure [4]Figure 4 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"). We find\nthat initialization is crucial for the efficacy of a winning ticket.\nThe right graph in Figure [3]Figure 3 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") shows this experiment for iterative pruning.\nIn addition to the original network and winning tickets at Pm=51%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent51P\\_{m}=51\\\\% and 21%percent2121\\\\% are the random reinitialization experiments.\nWhere the winning tickets learn faster as they are pruned, they learn progressively slower when randomly reinitialized.\n\nThe broader results of this experiment\nare orange line\nin Figure [4]Figure 4 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") a.\nUnlike winning tickets, the reinitialized networks learn increasingly slower than the original network and lose test accuracy after little pruning.\nThe average\nreinitialized iterative winning ticket\u2019s test accuracy drops off from the original accuracy when Pm=21.1%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent21.1P\\_{m}=21.1\\\\%, compared to\n2.9% for the winning ticket.

The networks have two, four, or six convolutional layers followed by\ntwo fully-connected layers; max-pooling occurs after every two convolutional layers. The networks cover a range from near-fully-connected to\ntraditional convolutional networks, with less than 1% of parameters\nin convolutional layers in Conv-2 to nearly two thirds in Conv-6.333Appendix [H]Appendix H Hyperparameter Exploration for Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") explores other hyperparameters, including learning rates, optimization strategies (SGD, momentum),\nand the relative rates at which to prune convolutional and fully-connected layers.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 5: Early-stopping iteration and test and training accuracy of the Conv-2/4/6 architectures when iteratively pruned and when\nrandomly reinitialized.\nEach solid line is the average of five trials; each dashed line is the average of fifteen reinitializations\n(three per trial). The bottom right graph plots test accuracy of winning tickets at iterations corresponding to the last iteration of training for the original network (20,000 for Conv-2, 25,000 for Conv-4, and 30,000 for Conv-6); at this iteration, training accuracy \u2248100%absentpercent100\\\\approx 100\\\\% for Pm\u22652%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent2P\\_{m}\\\\geq 2\\\\% for winning tickets (see Appendix [D]Appendix D Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")).\n\nFinding winning tickets. The solid lines in Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") (top) show the iterative lottery ticket experiment on\nConv-2 (blue), Conv-4 (orange), and Conv-6 (green) at the per-layer pruning rates from Figure [2]Figure 2 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"). The pattern\nfrom Lenet in Section [2]Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") repeats: as the network is pruned, it learns faster and test accuracy rises as compared to the original network.\nIn this case, the results are more pronounced.\nWinning tickets reach minimum validation loss at best 3.5x faster for Conv-2 (Pm=8.8%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent8.8P\\_{m}=8.8\\\\%), 3.5x for Conv-4 (Pm=9.2%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent9.2P\\_{m}=9.2\\\\%), and\n2.5x for Conv-6 (Pm=15.1%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent15.1P\\_{m}=15.1\\\\%). Test accuracy improves at best 3.4 percentage points for Conv-2 (Pm=4.6%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent4.6P\\_{m}=4.6\\\\%), 3.5\nfor Conv-4 (Pm=11.1%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent11.1P\\_{m}=11.1\\\\%), and 3.3 for Conv-6 (Pm=26.4%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent26.4P\\_{m}=26.4\\\\%). All three networks remain above their original average test accuracy when Pm>2%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent2P\\_{m}>2\\\\%.\n\nAs in Section [2]Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), training accuracy at the early-stopping iteration rises with test accuracy.\nHowever, at iteration 20,000 for Conv-2, 25,000 for Conv-4, and 30,000 for Conv-6 (the iterations corresponding to the final training iteration for the original network), training accuracy reaches 100% for all networks when Pm\u22652%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent2P\\_{m}\\\\geq 2\\\\% (Appendix [D]Appendix D Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), Figure [13]Figure 13 \u2023 Appendix D Training Accuracy for Lottery Ticket Experiments \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"))\nand winning tickets still maintain higher test accuracy (Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") bottom right). This means that the gap between\ntest and training accuracy is smaller for winning tickets, indicating they generalize better.\n\nRandom reinitialization. We repeat the random reinitialization experiment from Section [2]Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), which appears as the dashed lines in Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\").\nThese networks again take increasingly longer to learn upon continued pruning. Just as with Lenet on MNIST (Section [2]Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")), test accuracy drops off more\nquickly for the random reinitialization experiments. However, unlike Lenet, test accuracy at early-stopping time initially remains steady and even\nimproves for Conv-2 and Conv-4, indicating that\u2014at moderate levels of pruning\u2014the structure of the winning tickets alone may lead to better accuracy.\n\nDropout.\nDropout (Srivastava et al., [2014]); Hinton et al., [2012])) improves accuracy by randomly disabling a fraction of the units (i.e., randomly\nsampling a subnetwork) on each training iteration.\nBaldi & Sadowski ( [2013])) characterize dropout as simultaneously training the ensemble of all subnetworks.\nSince the lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that one of these subnetworks comprises a winning ticket, it is natural to ask whether dropout and our\nstrategy for finding winning tickets interact.\n\nFigure [6]Figure 6 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") shows the results of training Conv-2, Conv-4, and Conv-6 with a dropout rate of 0.5. Dashed lines are the network performance\nwithout dropout (the solid lines in Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")).444We choose new learning rates for the networks as trained with\ndropout\u2014see Appendix [H.5]H.5 Learning Rates (Dropout) \u2023 Appendix H Hyperparameter Exploration for Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"). We\ncontinue to find winning tickets when training with dropout. Dropout increases initial test accuracy\n(2.1, 3.0, and 2.4 percentage points on average for Conv-2, Conv-4, and Conv-6, respectively), and iterative pruning increases it further (up to an additional\n2.3, 4.6, and 4.7 percentage points, respectively, on average).\nLearning becomes faster with iterative pruning as before, but less dramatically in the case of Conv-2.\n\nThese improvements suggest that our\niterative pruning strategy interacts with dropout in a complementary way.\nSrivastava et al. ( [2014])) observe that dropout induces sparse activations in the final network; it is possible that dropout-induced\nsparsity primes a network to be pruned. If so, dropout techniques that target weights (Wan et al., [2013])) or learn per-weight dropout\nprobabilities (Molchanov et al., [2017]); Louizos et al., [2018])) could make winning tickets even easier to find.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 6: Early-stopping iteration and test accuracy at early-stopping of Conv-2/4/6 when iteratively pruned and trained with dropout.\nThe dashed lines are the same networks trained without dropout (the solid lines in Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 3 Winning Tickets in Convolutional Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")). Learning rates are 0.0003 for\nConv-2 and 0.0002 for Conv-4 and Conv-6.\n\n## 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10\nHere, we study the lottery ticket hypothesis on networks evocative of the architectures and techniques used in practice.\nSpecifically, we consider VGG-style deep convolutional networks (VGG-19 on CIFAR10\u2014Simonyan & Zisserman ( [2014]))) and residual\nnetworks (Resnet-18 on CIFAR10\u2014He et al. ( [2016]))).555See Figure [2]Figure 2 \u2023 2 Winning Tickets in Fully-Connected Networks \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") and Appendices [I]Appendix I Hyperparameter Exploration for VGG-19 and Resnet-18 on CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") for details on the networks, hyperparameters, and training regimes.\nThese networks are trained with batchnorm, weight decay,\ndecreasing learning rate schedules, and augmented training data.\nWe continue to find winning tickets for all of these architectures; however, our method for finding them, iterative pruning,\nis sensitive to the particular learning rate used. In these experiments, rather than measure early-stopping time (which, for these\nlarger networks, is entangled with learning rate schedules), we plot accuracy at several moments during training to illustrate\nthe relative rates at which accuracy improves.\n\nGlobal pruning.\nOn Lenet and Conv-2/4/6, we prune each layer separately at the same rate.\nFor Resnet-18 and VGG-19, we modify this strategy slightly:\nwe prune these deeper networks _globally_, removing the lowest-magnitude weights collectively across all convolutional layers.\nIn Appendix [I.1]I.1 Global Pruning \u2023 Appendix I Hyperparameter Exploration for VGG-19 and Resnet-18 on CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\"), we find that global pruning identifies smaller winning tickets for Resnet-18 and VGG-19. Our conjectured explanation for this behavior is as follows:\nFor these deeper networks, some layers have far more parameters than others.\nFor example, the first two convolutional layers of VGG-19 have 1728 and 36864 parameters, while the last has 2.35 million. When all layers are pruned at the same rate, these smaller layers become bottlenecks, preventing us from identifying the smallest possible winning tickets. Global pruning makes it possible to avoid this pitfall.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 7: Test accuracy (at 30K, 60K, and 112K iterations) of VGG-19 when iteratively pruned.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 8: Test accuracy (at 10K, 20K, and 30K iterations) of Resnet-18 when iteratively pruned.\n\nVGG-19. We study the variant VGG-19 adapted for CIFAR10 by Liu et al. ( [2019]));\nwe use the the same training regime and\nhyperparameters: 160 epochs (112,480 iterations)\nwith SGD with momentum (0.9) and decreasing the learning rate by a factor of 10 at 80 and 120 epochs.\nThis network has 20 million parameters.\nFigure [7]Figure 7 \u2023 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") shows the results of iterative\npruning and random reinitialization on VGG-19 at two initial learning rates: 0.1 (used in Liu et al. ( [2019]))) and 0.01.\nAt the higher learning rate, iterative pruning does not find winning tickets, and performance\nis no better than when the pruned networks are randomly reinitialized.\nHowever, at the lower learning rate, the usual pattern reemerges, with\nsubnetworks that remain within 1 percentage point of the original accuracy while Pm\u22653.5%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent3.5P\\_{m}\\\\geq 3.5\\\\%.\n(They are not winning tickets, since they do not match the original accuracy.)\nWhen randomly reinitialized, the subnetworks lose accuracy as they are pruned in the same manner as other experiments throughout this paper.\nAlthough these subnetworks learn faster than the unpruned network early in training (Figure [7]Figure 7 \u2023 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") left),\nthis accuracy advantage erodes later in training due to the lower initial learning rate. However, these\nsubnetworks still learn faster than when reinitialized.\n\nTo bridge the gap between the lottery ticket behavior of the lower learning rate and the accuracy advantage of the higher learning rate,\nwe explore the effect of linear learning rate warmup from 0 to the initial learning rate over k\ud835\udc58k iterations.\nTraining VGG-19 with warmup (k=10000\ud835\udc5810000k=10000, green line) at learning rate 0.1 improves the test accuracy of the unpruned network by about one percentage point.\nWarmup makes it possible to find winning tickets, exceeding this initial accuracy when Pm\u22651.5%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent1.5P\\_{m}\\\\geq 1.5\\\\%.\n\nResnet-18. Resnet-18 (He et al., [2016])) is a 20 layer convolutional network with residual connections designed for CIFAR10.\nIt has 271,000 parameters. We train the network for 30,000 iterations with SGD with momentum (0.9), decreasing\nthe learning rate by a factor of 10 at 20,000 and 25,000 iterations. Figure [8]Figure 8 \u2023 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") shows the results\nof iterative pruning and random reinitialization at learning rates 0.1 (used in He et al. ( [2016]))) and 0.01. These results largely mirror those of VGG:\niterative pruning finds winning tickets at the lower learning rate but not the higher learning rate.\nThe accuracy of the best winning tickets at the lower learning rate (89.5% when 41.7%\u2265Pm\u226521.9%percent41.7subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent21.941.7\\\\%\\\\geq P\\_{m}\\\\geq 21.9\\\\%) falls short of the original network\u2019s accuracy at the higher learning rate (90.5%).\nAt lower learning rate, the winning ticket again initially learns faster (left plots of Figure [8]Figure 8 \u2023 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\")), but falls behind the unpruned network\nat the higher learning rate later in training (right plot).\nWinning tickets trained with warmup close the accuracy gap with the unpruned network at the higher learning rate,\nreaching 90.5% test accuracy with learning rate 0.03 (warmup, k=20000\ud835\udc5820000k=20000) at Pm=27.1%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent27.1P\\_{m}=27.1\\\\%. For these hyperparameters, we still\nfind winning tickets when Pm\u226511.8%subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5apercent11.8P\\_{m}\\\\geq 11.8\\\\%. Even with warmup, however, we could not find hyperparameters for which\nwe could identify winning tickets at the original learning rate, 0.1.\n\n## 5 Discussion\nExisting work on neural network pruning (e.g., Han et al. ( [2015]))) demonstrates that the function\nlearned by a neural network can often be represented with fewer parameters. Pruning typically proceeds by training the original network, removing connections, and further fine-tuning.\nIn effect, the initial training initializes the weights of the\npruned network so that it can learn in isolation during fine-tuning.\nWe seek to determine if similarly sparse networks can learn from the\nstart.\nWe find that the architectures studied in this paper reliably contain such trainable subnetworks, and the lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that this property applies in general.\nOur empirical study of the existence and nature of winning tickets invites a number of follow-up questions.\n\nThe importance of winning ticket initialization.\nWhen randomly reinitialized, a winning ticket learns more slowly and achieves lower test accuracy, suggesting\nthat initialization is important to its success. One\npossible explanation for this behavior is these initial weights are close to their\nfinal values after training\u2014that in the most extreme case, they are already trained. However,\nexperiments in Appendix [F]Appendix F Examining Winning Tickets \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") show the opposite\u2014that\nthe winning ticket weights move further\nthan\nother weights. This suggests that the benefit of the initialization is connected\nto the optimization algorithm, dataset, and model. For example,\nthe winning ticket initialization might land in a region of the loss landscape\nthat is particularly amenable to optimization by the chosen optimization algorithm.\n\nLiu et al. ( [2019])) find that pruned networks are indeed trainable when randomly reinitialized,\nseemingly contradicting conventional wisdom and our random reinitialization experiments.\nFor example, on VGG-19 (for which we share the same setup),\nthey find that networks pruned by up to 80% and randomly reinitialized match the accuracy of the original network.\nOur experiments in Figure [7]Figure 7 \u2023 4 VGG and Resnet for CIFAR10 \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") confirm these findings at this level of sparsity (below which [Liu et al.]) do not present data). However, after further pruning, initialization matters:\nwe find winning tickets when VGG-19 is pruned by up to 98.5%; when reinitialized, these tickets reach much lower accuracy.\nWe hypothesize that\u2014up to a certain level of sparsity\u2014highly overparameterized networks can be pruned, reinitialized, and retrained successfully; however, beyond this point, extremely pruned, less severely overparamterized networks only maintain\naccuracy with fortuitous initialization.\n\nThe importance of winning ticket structure.\nThe initialization that gives rise to a winning ticket is arranged in a particular sparse architecture.\nSince we uncover winning tickets through heavy use of training data, we hypothesize that the structure of\nour winning tickets encodes an inductive bias customized to the learning task at hand. Cohen & Shashua ( [2016])) show that\nthe inductive bias embedded in the structure of a deep network determines the kinds of data that it can\nseparate more parameter-efficiently than can a shallow network; although Cohen & Shashua ( [2016])) focus on the\npooling geometry of convolutional networks, a similar effect may be at play with the structure of winning tickets, allowing them\nto learn even when heavily pruned.\n\nThe improved generalization of winning tickets.\nWe reliably find winning tickets that generalize better, exceeding the test accuracy of the original\nnetwork while matching its training accuracy.\nTest accuracy increases and then decreases as we prune, forming an Occam\u2019s Hill(Rasmussen & Ghahramani, [2001])) where the original, overparameterized model has too much\ncomplexity (perhaps overfitting) and the\nextremely pruned model has too little.\nThe conventional view of the relationship between compression and generalization is that compact hypotheses\ncan better generalize (Rissanen, [1986])). Recent theoretical work shows a similar link for neural networks,\nproving tighter generalization bounds for networks that can be compressed further\n(Zhou et al. ( [2018])) for pruning/quantization and Arora et al. ( [2018])) for noise robustness). The lottery ticket hypothesis offers a\ncomplementary perspective on this relationship\u2014that larger networks might explicitly contain simpler representations.\n\nImplications for neural network optimization.\nWinning tickets can reach accuracy equivalent to that of the\noriginal, unpruned network, but with significantly fewer parameters.\nThis observation connects to recent work on the role of\noverparameterization in neural network training.\nFor example,\nDu et al. ( [2019])) prove that sufficiently overparameterized two-layer relu\nnetworks (with fixed-size second layers) trained with SGD converge to\nglobal optima. A key question, then, is whether the presence of a winning ticket is\nnecessary or sufficient for SGD to optimize a neural network to a\nparticular test accuracy. We conjecture (but do not empirically show) that\nSGD seeks out and trains a well-initialized subnetwork. By this\nlogic, overparameterized networks are easier to train because they have more\ncombinations of subnetworks that are potential\nwinning tickets.\n\n## 6 Limitations and Future Work\nWe only consider vision-centric classification tasks on smaller\ndatasets (MNIST, CIFAR10). We do not investigate larger datasets (namely Imagenet (Russakovsky et al., [2015]))): iterative pruning is computationally intensive, requiring training a network 15 or more times consecutively for multiple trials. In future work, we intend to explore more efficient methods for finding winning tickets that will make it possible to\nstudy the lottery ticket hypothesis in more resource-intensive settings.\n\nSparse pruning is our only method for finding winning tickets.\nAlthough we reduce parameter-counts, the resulting architectures are not optimized for modern libraries or hardware. In future work,\nwe intend to study other pruning methods from the extensive contemporary literature, such as structured pruning (which would produce networks optimized for contemporary hardware) and non-magnitude pruning methods (which could produce smaller winning tickets or\nfind them earlier).\n\nThe winning tickets we find have initializations that allow them to match the performance of the unpruned networks at sizes too small for\nrandomly-initialized networks to do the same. In future work, we intend to study the properties of these initializations that, in concert with the inductive\nbiases of the pruned network architectures, make these networks particularly adept at learning.\n\nOn deeper networks (Resnet-18 and VGG-19), iterative pruning is unable to find winning tickets unless we train the networks with learning rate warmup. In future work, we plan to explore why warmup is necessary and whether other improvements to our scheme for identifying winning tickets could obviate the need for these hyperparameter modifications.\n\n## 7 Related Work\nIn practice, neural networks tend to be dramatically overparameterized.\nDistillation (Ba & Caruana, [2014]); Hinton et al., [2015])) and pruning (LeCun et al., [1990]); Han et al., [2015]))\nrely on the fact that parameters can be reduced while preserving accuracy. Even with\nsufficient capacity to memorize training data, networks naturally learn simpler functions (Zhang et al., [2016]); Neyshabur et al., [2014]); Arpit et al., [2017])).\nContemporary experience (Bengio et al., [2006]); Hinton et al., [2015]); Zhang et al., [2016])) and Figure [1]Figure 1 \u2023 1 Introduction \u2023 The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks\") suggest\nthat overparameterized networks are easier to train.\nWe show that\ndense networks contain sparse subnetworks capable of learning on their own starting from their original\ninitializations.\nSeveral other research directions aim to train small or sparse networks.\n\nPrior to training.\nSqueezenet (Iandola et al., [2016])) and MobileNets (Howard et al., [2017]))\nare specifically engineered image-recognition networks that are an order of magnitude smaller\nthan standard architectures.\nDenil et al. ( [2013])) represent weight matrices as products of lower-rank factors.\nLi et al. ( [2018])) restrict optimization\nto a small, randomly-sampled subspace of the parameter space (meaning all parameters can still be updated); they successfully train networks under this restriction.\nWe show that one need not even update\nall parameters to optimize a network, and we find winning tickets through a principled\nsearch process involving pruning.\nOur contribution to this class of approaches is to demonstrate that sparse, trainable networks exist within larger networks.\n\nAfter training. Distillation (Ba & Caruana, [2014]); Hinton et al., [2015])) trains small networks to mimic the behavior of large networks; small networks are\neasier to train in this paradigm.\nRecent pruning work compresses large models to run with limited resources (e.g., on mobile devices).\nAlthough pruning is central to our experiments, we study\nwhy training needs the overparameterized networks that make pruning possible.\nLeCun et al. ( [1990])) and Hassibi & Stork ( [1993])) first explored pruning based on second derivatives.\nMore recently, Han et al.

After capturing these features within a theoretical framework, we\nestablish their widespread existence in standard datasets. Finally, we present\na simple setting where we can rigorously tie the phenomena we observe in\npractice to a misalignment between the (human-specified) notion of robustness\nand the inherent geometry of the data.</Abstract><Content>\n## 1 Introduction\nThe pervasive brittleness of deep neural\nnetworks \\[ [Sze+14]), [Eng+19a]), [HD19]), [Ath+18])\\] has attracted\nsignificant attention in recent years.\nParticularly worrisome is the phenomenon\nof adversarial examples\\[ [Big+13]), [Sze+14])\\],\nimperceptibly perturbed natural inputs that induce erroneous predictions in state-of-the-art classifiers.\nPrevious work has proposed a variety of explanations for this\nphenomenon, ranging from theoretical models\n\\[ [Sch+18]), [BPR18])\\] to arguments based on\nconcentration of measure in high-dimensions\n\\[ [Gil+18]), [MDM18]), [Sha+19])\\]. These\ntheories, however, are often unable to fully capture behaviors we observe\nin practice (we discuss this further in Section [5]Related Work \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\")).\n\nMore broadly, previous work in the field tends to view adversarial examples\nas aberrations arising either from the high dimensional nature of the input\nspace or statistical fluctuations in the training\ndata \\[ [Sze+14]), [GSS15]), [Gil+18])\\].\nFrom this point of view, it is natural to treat adversarial robustness as a\ngoal that can be disentangled and pursued independently from maximizing\naccuracy \\[ [Mad+18]), [SHS19]), [Sug+19])\\],\neither through improved standard regularization\nmethods \\[ [TG16])\\] or\npre/post-processing of network\ninputs/outputs \\[ [Ues+18]), [CW17]), [He+17])\\].\n\nIn this work, we propose a new perspective on the phenomenon of adversarial examples.\nIn contrast to the previous models, we cast\nadversarial vulnerability as a fundamental consequence of the\ndominant supervised learning paradigm. Specifically, we claim that:\n\nAdversarial vulnerability is a direct result of\nour models\u2019 sensitivity to well-generalizing features in the data.\n\nRecall that we usually train classifiers to\nsolely maximize (distributional) accuracy. Consequently,\nclassifiers tend to use any available signal to do so, even those that look\nincomprehensible to humans. After all, the presence of \u201ca tail\u201d or\n\u201cears\u201d is no more natural to a classifier than any other equally\npredictive feature.\nIn fact, we find that standard ML datasets do\nadmit highly predictive yet imperceptible features.\nWe posit that our models learn to rely on these \u201cnon-robust\u201d features,\nleading to adversarial perturbations that exploit this dependence.222It is worth emphasizing that while our findings demonstrate that adversarial vulnerability does arise from non-robust features, they do not preclude the possibility of adversarial vulnerability also arising from other phenomena \\[ [TG16]), [Sch+18])\\]. For example, \\[ [Nak19])\\] constructs adversarial examples that do not exploit non-robust features (and hence do not allow one to learn a generalizing model from them). Still, the mere existence of useful non-robust features suffices to establish that without explicitly discouraging models from utilizing these features, adversarial vulnerability will remain an issue.\n\nOur hypothesis also suggests an explanation for adversarial transferability: the phenomenon that adversarial perturbations computed for one model often transfer to other,\nindependently trained models.\nSince any two models are likely to learn similar non-robust features, perturbations that manipulate such features will apply to both.\nFinally, this perspective establishes adversarial vulnerability as a\nhuman-centric phenomenon, since, from the standard supervised learning point\nof view, non-robust features can be as important as robust ones. It also\nsuggests that approaches aiming to enhance the interpretability of a given model by enforcing \u201cpriors\u201d for\nits\nexplanation \\[ [MV15]), [OMS17]), [Smi+17])\\] actually hide features that are \u201cmeaningful\u201d and predictive\nto standard models. As such, producing human-meaningful explanations that\nremain faithful to underlying models cannot be pursued independently from the\ntraining of the models themselves.\n\nTo corroborate our theory, we show that it is possible to disentangle robust from non-robust\nfeatures in standard image classification datasets.\nSpecifically, given any training dataset, we are able to construct:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nA \u201crobustified\u201d version for robust classification\n(Figure [1(a)]In Figure 1 \u2023 1 Introduction \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\"))333The corresponding datasets\nfor CIFAR-10 are publicly available at [http://git.io/adv-datasets]. .\nWe demonstrate that it is possible to\neffectively remove non-robust features from a dataset.\nConcretely, we create a training set (semantically similar to the original) on which standard\ntraining yields good robust accuracy on the original, unmodified test set.\nThis finding establishes that adversarial vulnerability is not necessarily\ntied to the standard training framework, but is also a property of the\ndataset.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nA \u201cnon-robust\u201d version for standard classification\n(Figure [1(b)]In Figure 1 \u2023 1 Introduction \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\"))22footnotemark: 2. We are also\nable to construct a training dataset for which the inputs are nearly identical to the originals,\nbut all appear incorrectly labeled. In fact, the inputs in the new training set are associated to their\nlabels only through small adversarial perturbations (and hence utilize only non-robust features).\nDespite the lack of any predictive human-visible information, training on this dataset\nyields good accuracy on the original, unmodified test set.\nThis demonstrates that adversarial perturbations can arise from flipping\nfeatures in the data that are useful for classification of correct inputs\n(hence not being purely aberrations).\n\n\nFinally, we present a concrete classification task where the\nconnection between adversarial examples and non-robust features can be studied rigorously.\nThis task consists of separating Gaussian distributions, and is loosely\nbased on the model presented in \\[ [Tsi+19])\\], while\nexpanding upon it in a few ways.\nFirst, adversarial vulnerability in our setting can be precisely quantified as\na difference between the intrinsic data geometry and that of the\nadversary\u2019s perturbation set.\nSecond, robust training yields a classifier which utilizes a geometry\ncorresponding to a combination of these two.\nLastly, the gradients of standard models can be significantly more\nmisaligned with the inter-class direction, capturing a phenomenon\nthat has been observed in practice in more complex scenarios \\[ [Tsi+19])\\].\n\n![Refer to caption](a)\n\n![Refer to caption](b)\n\nFigure 1: A conceptual diagram of the experiments of\nSection [3]Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\").

In particular, we present a set of\ndefinitions which allow us to formally describe our setup, theoretical\nresults, and empirical evidence.\n\n##### Setup.\n\nWe consider binary classification444Our framework can\nbe straightforwardly adapted though to the multi-class setting., where\ninput-label pairs (x,y)\u2208\ud835\udcb3\u00d7{\u00b11}\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66\ud835\udcb3plus-or-minus1(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\} are sampled from a (data)\ndistribution \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D}; the goal is to\nlearn a classifier C:\ud835\udcb3\u2192{\u00b11}:\ud835\udc36\u2192\ud835\udcb3plus-or-minus1C:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\rightarrow\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\} which predicts a label y\ud835\udc66y corresponding\nto a given input x\ud835\udc65x.\n\nWe define a feature to be a function mapping from the\ninput space \ud835\udcb3\ud835\udcb3\\\\mathcal{X} to the real numbers, with the set of all features thus\nbeing \u2131={f:\ud835\udcb3\u2192\u211d}\u2131conditional-set\ud835\udc53\u2192\ud835\udcb3\u211d\\\\mathcal{F}=\\\\{f:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\}.

For\ninstance, in principle, our theoretical framework would allow for useful\nnon-robust features to arise as combinations of useful robust features and\nuseless non-robust features \\[ [Goh19a])\\]. These types of\nconstructions, however, are actually precluded by our experimental results (in\nparticular, the classifiers trained in Section [3]Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\") would not\ngeneralize). This shows that our experimental findings capture a stronger, more\nfine-grained statement than our formal definitions are able to express. We view\nbridging this gap as an interesting direction for future work.\n\n## 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features\nThe central premise of our proposed framework is that there exist both robust and\nnon-robust features that constitute useful signals for standard classification. We now\nprovide evidence in support of this hypothesis by disentangling these two sets\nof features.\n\nOn one hand, we will construct a \u201crobustified\u201d dataset, consisting of samples that\nprimarily contain robust features. Using such a dataset, we are able\nto train robust classifiers (with respect to the standard test set) using\nstandard (i.e., non-robust) training.\nThis demonstrates that robustness can arise by removing certain features from\nthe dataset (as, overall, the new dataset contains less\ninformation about the original training set).\nMoreover, it provides evidence that adversarial vulnerability is caused by\nnon-robust features and is not inherently tied to the standard training framework.\n\nOn the other hand, we will construct datasets where the\ninput-label association is based purely on non-robust features (and thus\nthe corresponding dataset appears completely mislabeled\nto humans). We show that this dataset suffices to train a classifier with good\nperformance on the standard test set.

We then test this\nclassifier on the original test set (i.e. \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc9f\\\\mathcal{D}). The results\n(Figure [2(b)]In Figure 2 \u2023 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\")) indicate that the classifier learned\nusing the new dataset attains good accuracy in both standard and\nadversarial settings888In an attempt to explain the gap in\naccuracy between the model trained on \ud835\udc9f^Rsubscript^\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{D}}\\_{R} and the original\nrobust classifier C\ud835\udc36C, we test distributional shift, by reporting results\non the \u201crobustified\u201d test set in\nAppendix [D.3]D.3 Performance of \u201crobust\u201d training and test set \u2023 Appendix D Omitted Experiments and Figures \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\").999In order to gain more confidence in the robustness of the resulting\nmodel, we attempt several diverse attacks in Appendix [D.2]D.2 Adversarial evaluation \u2023 Appendix D Omitted Experiments and Figures \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\")..\n\nAs a control, we repeat this methodology using a standard (non-robust) model for C\ud835\udc36C in\nour construction of the dataset.

We find that training on this dataset leads to good standard\naccuracy, yet yields almost no robustness (Figure [2(b)]In Figure 2 \u2023 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\")). We\nalso verify that this procedure is not simply a matter of encoding the\nweights of the original model\u2014we get the same results for both \ud835\udc9f^Rsubscript^\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{D}}\\_{R}\nand \ud835\udc9f^N\u200bRsubscript^\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45\\\\widehat{\\\\mathcal{D}}\\_{NR} if we train with different architectures than that of the\noriginal models.\n\nOverall, our findings corroborate the hypothesis that adversarial examples\ncan arise from (non-robust) features of the data itself. By\nfiltering out non-robust features from the dataset (e.g. by restricting the\nset of available features to those used by a robust model), one can train a\nsignificantly more robust model using standard training.\n\n### 3.2 Non-robust features suffice for standard classification\n\nThe results of the previous section show that by restricting the dataset to\nonly contain features that are used by a robust model, standard training results\nin classifiers that are significantly more robust. This suggests that when training on the standard\ndataset, non-robust features take on a large role in the resulting learned\nclassifier. Here we set out to show that this role is not merely incidental or\ndue to finite-sample overfitting. In particular, we demonstrate that\nnon-robust features alone suffice for standard generalization\u2014\ni.e., a model trained solely on non-robust features can perform well on\nthe standard test set.\n\nTo show this, we construct a dataset where the only features that\nare useful for classification are non-robust features (or in terms of\nour formal model from Section [2]The Robust Features Model \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\"), all features f\ud835\udc53f that are \u03c1\ud835\udf0c\\\\rho-useful are\nnon-robust).\nTo accomplish this, we modify each input-label pair (x,y)\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66(x,y) as follows.\nWe select a target class t\ud835\udc61t either (a) uniformly at random among\nclasses (hence features become uncorrelated with the labels) or (b)\ndeterministically according to the source class (e.g. using a fixed permutation\nof labels).\nThen, we add a small adversarial perturbation to x\ud835\udc65x in order to ensure it is\nclassified as t\ud835\udc61t by a standard model.

The\\\nstrength of the adversary then allows for a trade-off between the\\\nenforced prior, and the data-dependent features.\\\n\\\n##### Robustness and accuracy.\\\n\\\nNote that in the setting described so far,\\\nrobustness can be at odds with\\\naccuracy since robust training prevents us from learning the most accurate\\\nclassifier (a similar\\\nconclusion is drawn in \\[ [Tsi+19])\\]).\\\nHowever, we note that there are very similar\\\nsettings where non-robust features manifest themselves in the same way, yet\\\na classifier with perfect robustness and accuracy is still attainable.\\\nConcretely, consider the distributions\\\npictured in Figure [14]Figure 14 \u2023 D.10 Robustness vs. Accuracy \u2023 Appendix D Omitted Experiments and Figures \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\") in Appendix\\\n[D.10]D.10 Robustness vs. Accuracy \u2023 Appendix D Omitted Experiments and Figures \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\"). It is straightforward to show that\\\nwhile there are many perfectly accurate classifiers, any standard loss\\\nfunction will learn an accurate yet non-robust classifier. Only when robust\\\ntraining is employed does the classifier learn a perfectly accurate and\\\nperfectly robust decision boundary.\\\n\\\n\n## 5 Related Work\\\n\\\nSeveral models for explaining adversarial examples have been proposed in\\\nprior work, utilizing ideas ranging from finite-sample overfitting to\\\nhigh-dimensional statistical\\\nphenomena\\\n\\[ [Gil+18]), [FFF18]), [For+19]), [TG16]), [Sha+19]), [MDM18]), [Sha+19a]), [GSS15]), [BPR18])\\].\\\nThe key differentiating aspect of our model is that adversarial\\\nperturbations\\\narise as well-generalizing, yet brittle, features, rather than\\\nstatistical anomalies or effects of poor statistical concentration.\\\nIn particular, adversarial vulnerability does not stem from using a specific\\\nmodel class or a specific training method, since standard training on the\\\n\u201crobustified\u201d data distribution of Section [3.1]Disentangling robust and non-robust features \u2023 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\") leads to robust\\\nmodels.\\\nAt the same time, as shown in Section [3.2]Non-robust features suffice for standard classification \u2023 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\"), these non-robust\\\nfeatures are sufficient to learn a good standard classifier.\\\nWe discuss the\\\nconnection between our model and others in detail in\\\nAppendix [A]Appendix A Connections to and Disambiguation from Other Models \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\").\\\nWe discuss additional related work in Appendix [B]Appendix B Additional Related Work \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\").\\\n\\\n\n## 6 Conclusion\\\n\\\nIn this work, we cast the phenomenon of adversarial\\\nexamples as a natural consequence of the presence of highly predictive\\\nbut non-robust features in standard ML datasets. We\\\nprovide support for this hypothesis by explicitly disentangling robust and\\\nnon-robust features in standard datasets, as well as showing\\\nthat non-robust features alone are sufficient for good generalization.\\\nFinally, we study these phenomena in more detail in a theoretical\\\nsetting where we can rigorously study adversarial vulnerability, robust\\\ntraining, and gradient alignment.\\\n\\\nOur findings prompt us to view adversarial examples as a fundamentally human phenomenon. In particular, we should not be\\\nsurprised that classifiers exploit highly predictive\\\nfeatures that happen to be non-robust under a human-selected notion of\\\nsimilarity, given such features exist in real-world datasets. In the same manner, from\\\nthe perspective of interpretability,\\\nas long as models rely on these non-robust features, we cannot expect to have model\\\nexplanations that are both human-meaningful and faithful to the models themselves.\\\nOverall, attaining models that are robust and interpretable\\\nwill require explicitly encoding human priors into the training process.\\\n\\\n\n## 7 Acknowledgements\\\n\\\nWe thank Preetum Nakkiran for suggesting the experiment of\\\nAppendix [D.9]D.9 Targeted Transferability \u2023 Appendix D Omitted Experiments and Figures \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\") (i.e. replicating\\\nFigure [3]Figure 3 \u2023 3.2 Non-robust features suffice for standard classification \u2023 3 Finding Robust (and Non-Robust) Features \u2023 Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features\") but with targeted attacks).

Such\nresearch is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear\ncomputations performed by millions of parameters, but valuable because it\nincreases our ability to understand current models and create improved versions\nof them. In this paper we investigate the extent to which neural networks\nexhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when the representations\nlearned by multiple nets converge to a set of features which are either\nindividually similar between networks or where subsets of features span similar\nlow-dimensional spaces. We propose a specific method of probing\nrepresentations: training multiple networks and then comparing and contrasting\ntheir individual, learned representations at the level of neurons or groups of\nneurons. We begin research into this question using three techniques to\napproximately align different neural networks on a feature level: a bipartite\nmatching approach that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons, a sparse\nprediction approach that finds one-to-many mappings, and a spectral clustering\napproach that finds many-to-many mappings. This initial investigation reveals a\nfew previously unknown properties of neural networks, and we argue that future\nresearch into the question of convergent learning will yield many more. The\ninsights described here include (1) that some features are learned reliably in\nmultiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned; (2) that\nunits learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are\ncommon to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not; (3)\nthat the representation codes show evidence of being a mix between a local code\nand slightly, but not fully, distributed codes across multiple units.</Abstract><Content>\n## 1 Introduction\nMany recent studies have focused on understanding deep neural networks from both a theoretical perspective\n(Arora et al., [2014]); Neyshabur & Panigrahy, [2013]); Montavon et al., [2011]); Paul & Venkatasubramanian, [2014]); Goodfellow et al., [2014]))\nand from an empirical perspective\n(Erhan et al., [2009]); Eigen et al., [2013]); Szegedy et al., [2013]); Simonyan et al., [2013]); Zeiler & Fergus, [2014]); Nguyen et al., [2014]); Yosinski et al., [2014]); Mahendran & Vedaldi, [2014]); Yosinski et al., [2015]); Zhou et al., [2014])).\nIn this paper we continue this trajectory toward attaining a deeper understanding of neural net training\nby proposing a new approach.\nWe begin by noting that modern deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit an interesting phenomenon:\nnetworks trained starting at different random initializations frequently converge to solutions with similar performance (see Dauphin et al. ( [2014])) and Section [2]Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") below).\nSuch similar performance by different networks raises the question of to what extent the learned internal representations differ:\nDo the networks learn radically different sets of features that happen to perform similarly, or do they exhibit _convergent learning_, meaning that their learned feature representations are largely the same?\nThis paper makes a first attempt at asking and answering these questions. Any improved understanding of what neural networks learn should improve our ability to design better architectures, learning algorithms, and hyperparameters, ultimately enabling more capable models. For instance, distributed data-parallel neural network training is more complicated than distributed data-parallel training of convex models because periodic direct averaging of model parameters is not an effective strategy: perhaps solving a neuron correspondence problem before averaging would mitigate the need for constant synchronization. As another example, if networks converge to diverse solutions, then perhaps additional performance improvements are possible via training multiple models and then using model compilation techniques to realize the resulting ensemble in a single model.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the similarities and differences between the representations learned by\nneural networks with the same architecture trained from different random initializations.\nWe employ an architecture derived from AlexNet\n(Krizhevsky et al., [2012]))\nand train multiple networks on the ImageNet dataset\n(Deng et al., [2009]))\n(details in Section [2]Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")). We then compare the representations learned\nacross different networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by both visually and quantitatively showing that the features learned by some neuron clusters in one network can be quite similar to those learned by neuron clusters in an independently trained neural network.\nOur specific contributions are asking and shedding light on the following questions:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nBy defining a measure of similarity between units222Note that we use the words \u201cfilters\u201d, \u201cchannels\u201d, \u201cneurons\u201d, and \u201cunits\u201d interchangeably to mean channels for a convolutional layer or individual units in a fully connected layer. in different neural networks,\ncan we come up with a permutation for the units of one network to bring it into a one-to-one alignment\nwith the units of another network trained on the same task? Is this matching or alignment close, because features learned by one network are learned nearly identically somewhere on the same layer of the second network, or is the approach ill-fated, because the representations of each network are unique?\n(Answer: a core representation is shared, but some rare features are learned in one network but not another; see Section [3]Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nAre the above one-to-one alignment results robust with respect to different measures of neuron similarity?\n(Answer: yes, under both linear correlation and estimated mutual information metrics; see Section [3.2]Alignment via Mutual Information \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nTo the extent that an accurate one-to-one neuron alignment is\nnot possible, is it simply because one network\u2019s representation\nspace is a rotated version333Or, more generally, a space that\nis an affine transformation of the first network\u2019s representation\nspace. of another\u2019s? If so, can we find and characterize these\nrotations?\n(Answers: by learning a sparse weight LASSO model to predict one\nrepresentation from only a few units of the other, we can see that the transform from\none space to the other can be possibly decoupled into transforms between\nsmall subspaces; see Section [4]Relaxing the One-to-One Constraint to Find Sparse, Few-to-One Mappings \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n4. 4.\n\n\nCan we further cluster groups of neurons from one network with a\nsimilar group from another network? (Answer: yes. To approximately\nmatch clusters, we adopt a spectral clustering algorithm\nthat enables many-to-many mappings to be found between networks. See\nSection [S.3]Appendix S.3 Does Relaxing the One-to-One Constraint to Find Many-to-Many Groupings Reveal More Similarities Between what Different Networks Learn? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n5. 5.\n\n\nFor two neurons detecting similar patterns, are the activation statistics similar as well?\n(Answer: mostly, but with some differences; see Section [S.4]Appendix S.4 Comparing Average Neural Activations within and between Networks \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n## 2 Experimental Setup\nAll networks in this study follow the basic architecture laid out by Krizhevsky et al. ( [2012])), with parameters learned in five convolutional layers (\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} \u2013 \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\\\\mathsf{conv5}) followed by three fully connected layers (\ud835\uddbf\ud835\uddbc\ud835\udfe8\ud835\uddbf\ud835\uddbc\ud835\udfe8\\\\mathsf{fc6} \u2013 \ud835\uddbf\ud835\uddbc\ud835\udfea\ud835\uddbf\ud835\uddbc\ud835\udfea\\\\mathsf{fc8}). The structure is modified slightly in two ways. First, Krizhevsky et al. ( [2012])) employed limited connectivity between certain pairs of layers to enable splitting the model across two GPUs.444In Krizhevsky et al. ( [2012])) the \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{conv2}, \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe6\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe6\\\\mathsf{conv4}, and \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\\\\mathsf{conv5} layers were only connected to half of the preceding layer\u2019s channels.\nHere we remove this artificial group structure and allow all channels on each layer to connect to all channels on the preceding layer, as we wish to study only the group structure, if any, that arises naturally, not that which is created by architectural choices. Second, we place the local response normalization layers after the pooling layers following the defaults released with the Caffe framework, which does not significantly impact performance (Jia et al., [2014])).\nNetworks are trained using Caffe on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 dataset (Deng et al., [2009])). Further details and the complete code necessary to reproduce these experiments is available at [https://github.com/yixuanli/convergent\\_learning].\n\nWe trained four networks in the above manner using four different random initializations. We refer to these as \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1}, \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2}, \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe5\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe5\\\\mathsf{Net3}, and \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe6\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe6\\\\mathsf{Net4}. The four networks perform very similarly on the validation set, achieving top-1 accuracies of\n58.65%, 58.73%, 58.79%, and 58.84%, which are similar to the top-1 performance of 59.3% reported in the original study (Krizhevsky et al., [2012])).\n\nWe then aggregate certain statistics of the activations within the networks.

We use correlation to measure similarity because it is independent of the scale of the activations of units.\nWithin-net correlation quantifies the similarity between two neurons in the same network; whereas the between-net correlation matrix quantifies the similarity of two neurons from different neural networks.\nNote that the units compared are always on the same layer on the network; we do not compare units between different layers.\nIn the Supplementary Information (see Figure [S1]Figure S1 \u2023 Appendix S.1 Activation Values: High Correlation vs. Low Correlation \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")),\nwe plot the activation values for several example high correlation and low correlation pairs of units from \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} and \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{conv2} layers; the simplicity of the distribution of values suggests that the correlation measurement is an adequate indicator of the similarity between two neurons. To further confirm this suspicion, we also tested with a full estimate of the mutual information between units and found it to yield similar results to correlation (see Section [3.2]Alignment via Mutual Information \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n## 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks?\nWe would like to investigate the similarities and differences between multiple training runs of same network\narchitecture. Due to symmetries in the architecture and weight initialization procedures, for any given parameter\nvector that is found, one could create many equivalent solutions simply by permuting the unit orders within a layer (and permuting\nthe outgoing weights accordingly). Thus, as a first step toward analyzing the similarities and differences\nbetween different networks, we ask the following question: if we allow ourselves to permute the units of one network,\nto what extent can we bring it into alignment with another?\nTo do so requires finding equivalent or nearly-equivalent units across networks, and for this task we adopt the magnitude independent measures of correlation and mutual information. We primarily give results with the simpler, computationally faster correlation measure (Section [3.1]Alignment via Correlation \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")), but then confirm the mutual information measure provides qualitatively similar results (Section [3.2]Alignment via Mutual Information \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")).\n\n### 3.1 Alignment via Correlation\n\nAs discussed in Section [2]Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\"), we compute within-net and between-net unit correlations.\nFigure [1]Figure 1 \u2023 2 Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") shows the within-net correlation values computed between units on a network and other units on the same network (panels a,b) as well as the between-net correlations between two different networks (panel c).\nWe find matching units between a pair of networks \u2014 here \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} and \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} \u2014 in two ways.

This procedure can result in multiple units of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} being paired with the same unit in \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2}.

To visualize the functionality each unit, we plot the image patch from the validation set that causes the highest activation for that unit. For all the layers shown, the most correlated filters (on the left) reveal that there are nearly perfect counterparts in each network, whereas the low-correlation filters (on the right) reveal that there are many features learned by one network that are unique and thus have no corollary in the other network.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2:  With assignments chosen by semi-matching, the eight best (highest correlation, left) and eight worst (lowest correlation, right) matched features between \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} and \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} for the \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} \u2013 \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe5\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe5\\\\mathsf{conv3} layers.

This more common approach is known as bipartite _matching_.777Note that the _semi-matching_ is \u201crow-wise greedy\u201d and will always have equal or better sum of correlation than the _matching_, which maximizes the same objective but must also satisfy global constraints. A matching that maximizes the sum\nof the chosen correlation values may be found efficiently\nvia the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm (Hopcroft & Karp, [1973])) after turning the between-net correlation matrix into a weighted bipartite graph.\nFigure [1]Figure 1 \u2023 2 Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") c shows an example between-net correlation matrix;\nthe max weighted matching can be thought of as a path through the matrix such that each row and each column are selected exactly once, and the sum of elements along the path is maximized.\nOnce such a path is found, we can permute the units of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} to bring it into the best possible alignment with \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1}, so that the first channel of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} approximately matches (has high correlation with) the first channel of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1}, the second channels of each also approximately match, and so on.\nThe correlation matrix of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} with the permuted version of \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} is shown in Figure [1]Figure 1 \u2023 2 Experimental Setup \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") d. Whereas the diagonal of the self correlation matrices are exactly one, the diagonal of the permuted between-net correlation matrix contains values that are generally less than one. Note that the diagonal of the permuted between-net correlation matrix is bright (close to white) in many places, which shows that for many units in \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} it is possible to find a unique, highly correlated unit in \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2}.\n\nFigure [3.1]Alignment via Correlation \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") shows a comparison of assignments produced by the semi-matching and matching methods for the \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} layer (Figure [S3]Figure S3 \u2023 Appendix S.2 Additional Matching Results \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") shows results for other layers).\nInsights into the differing representations learned can be gained from both assignment methods.\nThe first conclusion is that for most units, particularly those with the higher semi-matching and matching correlations (Figure [3.1]Alignment via Correlation \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\"), left), the semi-matching and matching assignments coincide, revealing that for many units a one-to-one assignment is possible.\nBoth methods reveal that the average correlation for one-to-one alignments varies from layer to layer (Figure [3.1]Alignment via Correlation \u2023 3 Is There a One-to-One Alignment Between Features Learned by Different Neural Networks? \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")), with the highest matches in the \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} and \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\\\\mathsf{conv5} layers, but worse matches in between.

This result may be related to previously\nobserved greater complexity in the intermediate layers as measured through the lens of optimization difficulty (Yosinski et al., [2014])).\n\nNext, we can see that where the semi-matching and matching differ, the matching is often much worse.One hypothesis for why this occurs\nis that the two networks learn different numbers of units to span certain subspaces.

This sparsity pressure can be varied from quite\nstrong (encouraging a mostly one-to-one mapping) all the way to zero,\nwhich encourages the learned linear model to be dense.\nMore\nspecifically, to predict one layer\u2019s representation from another, we\nlearn a single mapping layer from one to the other (similar to the \u201cstitching layer\u201d in Lenc & Vedaldi ( [2015]))). In the case of\nconvolutional layers, this mapping layer is a convolutional layer\nwith 1\u00d71111\\\\times 1 kernel size and number of output channels equal to the\nnumber of input channels. The mapping layer\u2019s parameters can be considered as a square weight matrix with side length equal to the number of units in the layer; the layer learns to predict any unit in one network via a linear weighted sum of any number of units in the other. The model and resulting square weight\nmatrices are shown in Figure [5]Figure 5 \u2023 4 Relaxing the One-to-One Constraint to Find Sparse, Few-to-One Mappings \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\"). This layer is\nthen trained to minimize the sum of squared prediction errors plus\nan L1 penalty, the strength of which is varied.999Both representations\n(input and target) are taken after the relu is applied. Before\ntraining, each channel is normalized to have mean zero and standard\ndeviation 1/N1\ud835\udc411/\\\\sqrt{N}, where N\ud835\udc41N is the number of dimensions of the\nrepresentation at that layer (e.g. N=55\u22c555\u22c596=290400\ud835\udc41\u22c5555596290400N=55\\\\cdot 55\\\\cdot 96=290400\nfor \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1}). This normalization has two effects.\nFirst, the\nchannels in a layer are all given equal importance, without which the channels\nwith large activation values (see Figure [S10]Figure S10 \u2023 Appendix S.4 Comparing Average Neural Activations within and between Networks \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\")) dominate\nthe cost and are predicted well at the expense of less\nactive channels, a solution which provides little information about\nthe less active channels.\nSecond, the representation at any layer\nfor a single image becomes approximately unit length, making the\ninitial cost about the same on all layers and allowing the same\nlearning rate and SGD momentum hyperparameters to be used for all\nlayers. It also makes the effect of specific L1 multipliers approximately commensurate and\nallows for rough comparison of prediction performance between layers, because the scale is constant.\n\n|  | Sparse Prediction Loss (after 4,500 iterations) |\n|  | decay 0 | decay 10\u22125superscript10510^{-5} | decay 10\u22124superscript10410^{-4} | decay 10\u22123superscript10310^{-3} | decay 10\u22122superscript10210^{-2} | decay 10\u22121superscript10110^{-1} |\n| \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1} | 0.170 | 0.169 | 0.162 | 0.172 | 0.484 | 0.517 |\n| \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{conv2} | 0.372 | 0.368 | 0.337 | 0.392 | 0.518 | 0.514 |\n| \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe5\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe5\\\\mathsf{conv3} | 0.434 | 0.427 | 0.383 | 0.462 | 0.497 | 0.496 |\n| \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe6\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe6\\\\mathsf{conv4} | 0.478 | 0.470 | 0.423 | 0.477 | 0.489 | 0.488 |\n| \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe7\\\\mathsf{conv5} | 0.484 | 0.478 | 0.439 | 0.436 | 0.478 | 0.477 |\n\nTable 1:\nAverage prediction error for mapping layers with varying L1 penalties (i.e. decay terms).

Units that do not match well one-to-one, but are predicted well by a sparse model, suggest the presence, along those dimensions, of _slightly distributed_ codes.\n\nThe results could have been otherwise: if all units could accurately be matched one-to-one, we would suspect a local code across the whole layer. On the other hand, if making predictions from one network to another required a dense affine transformation, then we would interpret the code as _fully distributed_, with each unit serving only as a basis vector used to span a large dimensional subspace, whose only requirement was to have large projection onto the subspace (to be useful) and small projection onto other basis vectors (to be orthogonal). The story that actually emerges is that the first two layers use a mix of a local and a slightly distributed code.\n\nFigure [6]Figure 6 \u2023 4 Relaxing the One-to-One Constraint to Find Sparse, Few-to-One Mappings \u2023 Convergent Learning: Do different neural networks learn the same representations?\") shows a visualization of the learned weight matrix for \ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcf\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{conv1},\nalong with a permuted weight matrix that aligns units from \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} with the \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} units that most predict them.\nWe also show two example units in \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe4\\\\mathsf{Net2} and, for each, the only three units in \ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\ud835\uddad\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddcd\ud835\udfe3\\\\mathsf{Net1} that are needed to predict their activation values.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5:\nA visualization of the network-to-network sparse \u201cmapping layers\u201d (green squares).

We show how insights may be gain by approximately aligning different neural networks on a feature or subspace level by blending three approaches: a bipartite matching that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons, a sparse prediction and clustering approach that finds one-to-many mappings, and a spectral clustering approach that finds many-to-many mappings. Our main findings include:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nSome features are learned reliably in multiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nUnits learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are common to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nThe representation codes are a mix between a local (single unit) code and slightly, but not fully, distributed codes across multiple units.\n\n4. 4.\n\n\nThe average activation values of neurons vary considerably within a network, yet the mean activation values across different networks converge to an almost identical distribution.\n\n## 6 Future Work\nThe findings in this paper open up new future research directions, for example: (1) Model compression. How would removing low-correlation, rare filters affect performance? (2) Optimizing ensemble formation. The results show some features (and subspaces) are shared between independently trained DNNs, and some are not. This suggests testing how feature correlation among different DNNs in an ensemble affects ensemble performance. For example, the \u201cshared cores\u201d of multiple networks could be deduplicated, but the unique features in the tails of their feature sets could be kept. (3) Similarly, one could (a) post-hoc assemble ensembles with greater diversity, or even (b) directly encourage ensemble feature diversity during training. (4) Certain visualization techniques, e.g., deconv (Zeiler & Fergus, [2014])), DeepVis (Yosinski et al., [2015])), have revealed neurons with multiple functions (e.g. detectors that fire for wheels and faces). The proposed matching methods could reveal more about why these arise. Are these units consistently learned because they are helpful or are they just noisy, imperfect features found in local optima?\n(5) Model combination: can multiple models be combined by concatenating their features, deleting those with high overlap, and then fine-tuning?\n(6) Apply the analysis to networks with different architectures \u2014 for example, networks with different numbers of layers or different layer sizes \u2014 or networks trained on different subsets of the training data.\n(7) Study the correlations of features in the same network, but across training iterations, which could show whether some features are trained early and not changed much later, versus perhaps others being changed in the later stages of fine-tuning. This could lead to complementary\ninsights on learning dynamics to those reported by Erhan et al. ( [2009])).\n(8) Study whether particular regularization or optimization strategies (e.g., dropout, ordered dropout, path SGD, etc.) increase or decrease the convergent properties of the representations to facilitate different goals (more convergent would be better for data-parallel training, and less convergent would be better for ensemble formation and compilation).\n\n#### Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to the NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship (JY) for funding, Wendy Shang for conversations\nand initial ideas, Yoshua Bengio for modeling suggestions, and Anh Nguyen and Kilian Weinberger for helpful comments and edits.\nThis work was supported in part by US Army Research Office W911NF-14-1-0477, NSF grant 1527232.\nJeff Clune was supported by an NSF CAREER award (CAREER: 1453549) and a hardware donation from the NVIDIA Corporation.\n</Content></Candidate>\n\n<Candidate>Candidate [3]:\nAttention is All you Need.\n\n<Abstract>Abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or\nconvolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration.

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures \\[ [38]), [24]), [15])\\].\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states htsubscript\u210e\ud835\udc61h\\_{t}, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121subscript\u210e\ud835\udc611h\\_{t-1} and the input for position t\ud835\udc61t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.\nRecent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks \\[ [21])\\] and conditional computation \\[ [32])\\], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences \\[ [2]), [19])\\]. In all but a few cases \\[ [27])\\], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n\n## 2 Background\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU \\[ [16])\\], ByteNet \\[ [18])\\] and ConvS2S \\[ [9])\\], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions \\[ [12])\\]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section [3.2]Attention \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\").\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations \\[ [4]), [27]), [28]), [22])\\].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks \\[ [34])\\].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution.\nIn the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as \\[ [17]), [18])\\] and \\[ [9])\\].\n\n## 3 Model Architecture\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure \\[ [5]), [2]), [35])\\]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,\u2026,xn)subscript\ud835\udc651\u2026subscript\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b(x\\_{1},...,x\\_{n}) to a sequence of continuous representations \ud835\udc33=(z1,\u2026,zn)\ud835\udc33subscript\ud835\udc671\u2026subscript\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5b\\\\mathbf{z}=(z\\_{1},...,z\\_{n}). Given \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc33\\\\mathbf{z}, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,\u2026,ym)subscript\ud835\udc661\u2026subscript\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5a(y\\_{1},...,y\\_{m}) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive \\[ [10])\\], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure [1]Figure 1 \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\"), respectively.\n\n### 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n\n##### Encoder:\n\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N=6\ud835\udc416N=6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection \\[ [11])\\] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization \\[ [1])\\]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm\u200b(x+Sublayer\u200b(x))LayerNorm\ud835\udc65Sublayer\ud835\udc65\\\\mathrm{LayerNorm}(x+\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x)), where Sublayer\u200b(x)Sublayer\ud835\udc65\\\\mathrm{Sublayer}(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel=512subscript\ud835\udc51model512d\\_{\\\\text{model}}=512.\n\n##### Decoder:\n\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N=6\ud835\udc416N=6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i\ud835\udc56i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i\ud835\udc56i.\n\n### 3.2 Attention\n\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n\n#### 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure [2]Figure 2 \u2023 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention \u2023 3.2 Attention \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\")). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k}, and values of dimension dvsubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63d\\_{v}. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58\\\\sqrt{d\\_{k}}, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\n\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q\ud835\udc44Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K\ud835\udc3eK and V\ud835\udc49V. We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Attention\u200b(Q,K,V)=softmax\u200b(Q\u200bKTdk)\u200bVAttention\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc49softmax\ud835\udc44superscript\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc47subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc49\\\\mathrm{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\mathrm{softmax}(\\\\frac{QK^{T}}{\\\\sqrt{d\\_{k}}})V |  | (1) |\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention \\[ [2])\\], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of 1dk1subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d\\_{k}}}. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k} the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k}\\[ [3])\\]. We suspect that for large values of dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k}, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 111To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q\ud835\udc5eq and k\ud835\udc58k are independent random variables with mean 00 and variance 111. Then their dot product, q\u22c5k=\u2211i=1dkqi\u200bki\u22c5\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc58superscriptsubscript\ud835\udc561subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58subscript\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56subscript\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56q\\\\cdot k=\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{d\\_{k}}q\\_{i}k\\_{i}, has mean 00 and variance dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k}.. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1dk1subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d\\_{k}}}.\n\n#### 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nMulti-Head Attention\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.\n\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodelsubscript\ud835\udc51modeld\\_{\\\\text{model}}-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h\u210eh times with different, learned linear projections to dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k}, dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k} and dvsubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63d\\_{v} dimensions, respectively.\nOn each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dvsubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63d\\_{v}-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure [2]Figure 2 \u2023 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention \u2023 3.2 Attention \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\").\n\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as \\[ [38]), [2]), [9])\\].\n\n- \u2022\n\n\nThe encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n\n- \u2022\n\n\nSimilarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to \u2212\u221e-\\\\infty) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure [2]Figure 2 \u2023 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention \u2023 3.2 Attention \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\").\n\n\n### 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | FFN\u200b(x)=max\u2061(0,x\u200bW1+b1)\u200bW2+b2FFN\ud835\udc650\ud835\udc65subscript\ud835\udc4a1subscript\ud835\udc4f1subscript\ud835\udc4a2subscript\ud835\udc4f2\\\\mathrm{FFN}(x)=\\\\max(0,xW\\_{1}+b\\_{1})W\\_{2}+b\\_{2} |  | (2) |\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel=512subscript\ud835\udc51model512d\\_{\\\\text{model}}=512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality df\u200bf=2048subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc532048d\\_{ff}=2048.\n\n### 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodelsubscript\ud835\udc51modeld\\_{\\\\text{model}}. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to \\[ [30])\\]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by dmodelsubscript\ud835\udc51model\\\\sqrt{d\\_{\\\\text{model}}}.\n\n### 3.5 Positional Encoding\n\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodelsubscript\ud835\udc51modeld\\_{\\\\text{model}} as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed \\[ [9])\\].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | P\u200bE(p\u200bo\u200bs,2\u200bi)=s\u200bi\u200bn\u200b(p\u200bo\u200bs/100002\u200bi/dmodel)\ud835\udc43subscript\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60superscript100002\ud835\udc56subscript\ud835\udc51model\\\\displaystyle PE\\_{(pos,2i)}=sin(pos/10000^{2i/d\\_{\\\\text{model}}}) |  |\n|  | P\u200bE(p\u200bo\u200bs,2\u200bi+1)=c\u200bo\u200bs\u200b(p\u200bo\u200bs/100002\u200bi/dmodel)\ud835\udc43subscript\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc561\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60superscript100002\ud835\udc56subscript\ud835\udc51model\\\\displaystyle PE\\_{(pos,2i+1)}=cos(pos/10000^{2i/d\\_{\\\\text{model}}}) |  |\n\nwhere p\u200bo\u200bs\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60pos is the position and i\ud835\udc56i is the dimension.

We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.\n\n## 4 Why Self-Attention\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,\u2026,xn)subscript\ud835\udc651\u2026subscript\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b(x\\_{1},...,x\\_{n}) to another sequence of equal length (z1,\u2026,zn)subscript\ud835\udc671\u2026subscript\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc5b(z\\_{1},...,z\\_{n}), with xi,zi\u2208\u211ddsubscript\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56subscript\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56superscript\u211d\ud835\udc51x\\_{i},z\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer.\nAnother is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies \\[ [12])\\]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nTable 1:\nMaximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations for different layer types. n\ud835\udc5bn is the sequence length, d\ud835\udc51d is the representation dimension, k\ud835\udc58k is the kernel size of convolutions and r\ud835\udc5fr the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\n| Layer Type | Complexity per Layer | Sequential | Maximum Path Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Operations |  |\n| Self-Attention | O\u200b(n2\u22c5d)\ud835\udc42\u22c5superscript\ud835\udc5b2\ud835\udc51O(n^{2}\\\\cdot d) | O\u200b(1)\ud835\udc421O(1) | O\u200b(1)\ud835\udc421O(1) |\n| Recurrent | O\u200b(n\u22c5d2)\ud835\udc42\u22c5\ud835\udc5bsuperscript\ud835\udc512O(n\\\\cdot d^{2}) | O\u200b(n)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5bO(n) | O\u200b(n)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5bO(n) |\n| Convolutional | O\u200b(k\u22c5n\u22c5d2)\ud835\udc42\u22c5\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5bsuperscript\ud835\udc512O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d^{2}) | O\u200b(1)\ud835\udc421O(1) | O\u200b(l\u200bo\u200bgk\u200b(n))\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5csubscript\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5bO(log\\_{k}(n)) |\n| Self-Attention (restricted) | O\u200b(r\u22c5n\u22c5d)\ud835\udc42\u22c5\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51O(r\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d) | O\u200b(1)\ud835\udc421O(1) | O\u200b(n/r)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5fO(n/r) |\n\nAs noted in Table [1]Table 1 \u2023 4 Why Self-Attention \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\"), a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O\u200b(n)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5bO(n) sequential operations.\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n\ud835\udc5bn is smaller than the representation dimensionality d\ud835\udc51d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece \\[ [38])\\] and byte-pair \\[ [31])\\] representations.\nTo improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r\ud835\udc5fr in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O\u200b(n/r)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5fO(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5bk<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O\u200b(n/k)\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc58O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O\u200b(l\u200bo\u200bgk\u200b(n))\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5csubscript\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5bO(log\\_{k}(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions \\[ [18])\\], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network.\nConvolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k\ud835\udc58k. Separable convolutions \\[ [6])\\], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O\u200b(k\u22c5n\u22c5d+n\u22c5d2)\ud835\udc42\u22c5\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc5bsuperscript\ud835\udc512O(k\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot d+n\\\\cdot d^{2}). Even with k=n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5bk=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.\n\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n## 5 Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n### 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding \\[ [3])\\], which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary \\[ [38])\\]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\n### 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table [3]Table 3 \u2023 6.2 Model Variations \u2023 6 Results \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\")), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).\n\n### 5.3 Optimizer\n\nWe used the Adam optimizer \\[ [20])\\] with \u03b21=0.9subscript\ud835\udefd10.9\\\\beta\\_{1}=0.9, \u03b22=0.98subscript\ud835\udefd20.98\\\\beta\\_{2}=0.98 and \u03f5=10\u22129italic-\u03f5superscript109\\\\epsilon=10^{-9}.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pd\u200br\u200bo\u200bp=0.1subscript\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d0.1P\\_{drop}=0.1.\n\n##### Label Smoothing\n\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value \u03f5l\u200bs=0.1subscriptitalic-\u03f5\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc600.1\\\\epsilon\\_{ls}=0.1\\[ [36])\\].

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table [3]Table 3 \u2023 6.2 Model Variations \u2023 6 Results \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\").\n\nIn Table [3]Table 3 \u2023 6.2 Model Variations \u2023 6 Results \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\") rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section [3.2.2]Multi-Head Attention \u2023 3.2 Attention \u2023 3 Model Architecture \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\"). While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\nIn Table [3]Table 3 \u2023 6.2 Model Variations \u2023 6 Results \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\") rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dksubscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58d\\_{k} hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings \\[ [9])\\], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.\n\n### 6.3 English Constituency Parsing\n\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parser | Training | WSJ 23 F1 |\n| Vinyals & Kaiser el al.

(2016) \\[ [8])\\] | generative | 93.3 |\n\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input.\nFurthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes \\[ [37])\\].\n\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dm\u200bo\u200bd\u200be\u200bl=1024subscript\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc591024d\\_{model}=1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank \\[ [25])\\], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences \\[ [37])\\]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.\n\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section [5.4]Regularization \u2023 5 Training \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\")), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300300300. We used a beam size of 212121 and \u03b1=0.3\ud835\udefc0.3\\\\alpha=0.3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\n\nOur results in Table [4]Table 4 \u2023 6.3 English Constituency Parsing \u2023 6 Results \u2023 Attention Is All You Need\") show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar \\[ [8])\\].\n\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models \\[ [37])\\], the Transformer outperforms the BerkeleyParser \\[ [29])\\] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.\nMaking generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor].\n\n##### Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for\ntheir fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n</Content></Candidate>\n\n</References>\nRemember to output the index of the selected reference enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.",
