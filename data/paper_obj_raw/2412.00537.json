In addition,\ndata poisoning has been observed in practice and is recognized as a critical concern for practitioners and enterprises (Kumar et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib28 \"\"); Grosse et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib17 \"\"); Cinà et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib9 \"\")). The practical feasibility was impressively demonstrated by Carlini et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib6 \"\")), who showed that with only $60 USD they could have poisoned several commonly used web-scale datasets.\n\nLabel flipping is a special type of data poisoning where a fraction of the training labels are corrupted, leaving the features unaffected. This type of attack has proven widespread effectivity ranging from classical methods for i.i.d. or graph data (Biggio et al., [2011](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib3 \"\"); Liu et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib34 \"\")), to modern\ndeep learning systems for images, text, or\ngraph-based learning (Jha et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib22 \"\"); Wan et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib46 \"\"); Lingam et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib32 \"\")). Exemplary, Lingam et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib32 \"\")) showed that one adversarial label flip could reduce the accuracy of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, [2017](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib25 \"\")) by over 17%percent1717\\\\%\non a smaller version of Cora-ML (McCallum et al., [2000](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib36 \"\")). Similarly, [Fig.1(a)](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S1.F1.sf1 \"In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") demonstrates for the Karate Club network (Zachary, [1977](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib51 \"\")) that one label-flip can reduce the accuracy of a GCN by 50%.\n\nAlthough several empirical defenses have been developed to counter label flipping attacks (Zhang et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib52 \"\"); Paudice et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib40 \"\")), they remain vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated attacks (Koh et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib27 \"\")). This highlights the need for _robustness certificates_ which offer formal guarantees that the test predictions remain unaffected under a given perturbation model. However, there are currently no works on certifying label poisoning for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and as a result, little is known about the worst-case (adversarial) robustness of different architectural choices.\nThat a difference in behavior can be expected is motivated in [Fig.1(a)](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S1.F1.sf1 \"In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), where exchanging the ReLU in a GCN with an identity function forming a Simplified Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) (Wu et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib48 \"\")), results in significantly higher worst-case robustness to label flipping for Karate Club.\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537/assets/figures/introduction/karate_train_test_bold.png)\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537/assets/figures/introduction/karate_gcn_0.001_bold.png)\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537/assets/figures/introduction/karate_sgc_0.001_bold.png)\n\n(a) Worst-case robustness to one label flip of two GNNs.![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537/assets/figures/introduction/certificate_combined.png)(b) Illustration of our label-flipping certificate.\n\nFigure 1: (a) The Karate Club network is visualized with its labeled ( ) and unlabeled ( ) nodes.\nThe adversarial\nlabel flip ( ) calculated by our method outlined in\n(b) provably leads to most node predictions being flipped ( ) for two GNNs (GCN & SGC).\nThe certified accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified nodes that remain robust to the attack.\n\nIn general, robustness certificates can be divided into being exact (also known as complete), i.e., returning the exact adversarial robustness of a model representing its worst-case robustness to a given perturbation model, or incomplete, representing an underestimation of the exact robustness. Complete certificates allow us to characterize and compare the effect different architectural choices have on worst-case robustness as exemplified in [Fig.1(a)](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S1.F1.sf1 \"In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), whereas incomplete certificates suffer from having variable tightness for different models, making meaningful comparisons difficult (Li et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib31 \"\")). Currently, even for i.i.d. data there are no exact poisoning certificates for NNs, and existing approaches to certify label-flipping are limited to randomized smoothing (Rosenfeld et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib41 \"\")) and partition-based aggregation (Levine & Feizi, [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib30 \"\")), which offer incomplete guarantees for smoothed or ensembles of classifiers. Thus, adapting these techniques to graphs will not enable us to understand the effect of specific architectural choices for GNNs on their worst-case robustness. The lack of exact certificates can be understood due to the inherent complexity of capturing the effect a change in the training data has on the training dynamics and consequently, is an unsolved problem. This raises the question:\n_is it even possible to compute exact certificates against label poisoning?_\n\nIn this work, we resolve this question by first deriving _exact sample-wise_ robustness certificates for sufficiently wide NNs against label flipping and evaluate them for different GNNs focusing on semi-supervised node classification. Based on our sample-wise derivation we develop an _exact collective_ certification strategy that certifies the entire test set simultaneously. This is of particular importance for poisoning certificates, as a model is usually trained once on a given training set and then evaluated. Consequently, an attacker can only choose one perturbation to the training set targeting the performance on all test points. To capture the effect of label flipping on the training process of a network, our approach takes inspiration from Gosch et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib16 \"\")) and makes use of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of different GNNs (Sabanayagam et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib43 \"\")), which precisely characterizes the training dynamics of sufficiently wide NNs (Arora et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib2 \"\")). Concretely, we leverage the equivalence of a wide NN trained using the soft-margin loss with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that uses the NTK of the network as its kernel (Chen et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib8 \"\")). This allows us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem describing label flipping as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) yielding a certificate for wide NNs as illustrated in [Fig.1(b)](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S1.F1.sf2 \"In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"). As the MILP scales with the number of labeled data, our method is a good fit to certify GNNs for semi-supervised node-classification on graphs, due to the usually encountered sparse labeling.\nWhile Gosch et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib16 \"\")) were the first to use the NTK\nto derive model-specific poisoning certificates, their work is limited to feature perturbations and incomplete sample-wise certification.\nThus, our contributions are:\n\n(i) We derive the _first exact robustness certificates_ for NNs against label flipping. Next to sample-wise certificates ( [Sec.3.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.SS1 \"3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")), we develop _exact collective certificates_ ( [Sec.3.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.SS2 \"3.2 Collective Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")) particularly important for characterizing the worst-case robustness of different architectures to label poisoning. Concretely, our certificates apply to infinite-width NNs and hold with high probability for wide finite-width NNs.\n\n(ii) We apply our certificates to a wide-range of GNNs for node-classification on both, real and synthetic data ( [Sec.4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S4 \"4 Experimental Results ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")). Thereby, we establish that worst-case robustness hierarchies are highly data-dependent, and quantify the effect of different graph properties and architectural choices (e.g., activations, depth, skip-connections)\non worst-case robustness.\n\n(iii) Using the collective certificate, we uncover a surprising phenomenon: across all datasets, most architectures show a worst-case robustness plateaus for intermediate attack budgets so far not observed with adversarial attacks (Lingam et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib32 \"\")).\n\n(iv) Beyond (wide) NNs, our MILP reformulation is valid for SVMs with arbitrary kernel choices. Thus, it is the first certificate for kernelized SVMs against label flipping.\n\nNotation.\nWe use bold upper and lowercase letters to denote a matrix 𝐀𝐀{\\\\mathbf{A}} and vector 𝐚𝐚{\\\\mathbf{a}}, respectively. The i𝑖i-th entry of a vector 𝐚𝐚{\\\\mathbf{a}} is denoted by aisubscript𝑎𝑖a\\_{i}, and the i​j𝑖𝑗ij-entry of a matrix 𝐀𝐀{\\\\mathbf{A}} by Ai​jsubscript𝐴𝑖𝑗A\\_{ij}.\nWe use the floor operator ⌊n⌋𝑛\\\\lfloor n\\\\rfloor for the greatest integer ≤nabsent𝑛\\\\leq n, and\n\\[n\\]delimited-\\[\\]𝑛\\[n\\] to denote {1,2,…,n}12…𝑛\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\}.\nFurther, ⟨.,.⟩\\\\left\\\\langle.,.\\\\right\\\\rangle for scalar product, 𝔼​\\[⋅\\]absent𝔼delimited-\\[\\]⋅\\\\underset{}{\\\\mathbb{E}}\\\\left\\[\\\\cdot\\\\right\\] for the expectation and 𝟙\\[.\\]\\\\mathbbm{1}\\[.\\] for the indicator function.\nWe use ∥⋅∥psubscriptdelimited-∥∥⋅𝑝\\\\lVert\\\\cdot\\\\rVert\\_{p} with p=2𝑝2p=2 for vector Euclidean norm and matrix Frobenius norm, and p=0𝑝0p=0 for vector 00-norm.\n\n## 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries\n\nWe consider semi-supervised node classification, where the input graph 𝒢=(𝑺,𝑿)𝒢𝑺𝑿\\\\mathcal{G}=({\\\\bm{S}},{\\\\bm{X}}) contains n𝑛n nodes, each associated with a feature vector 𝒙i∈ℝdsubscript𝒙𝑖superscriptℝ𝑑{\\\\bm{x}}\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} aggregated in the feature matrix 𝑿∈ℝn×d𝑿superscriptℝ𝑛𝑑{\\\\bm{X}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}. Graph structure is encoded in 𝑺∈ℝ≥0n×n𝑺superscriptsubscriptℝabsent0𝑛𝑛{\\\\bm{S}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}\\_{\\\\geq 0}^{n\\\\times n}, typically representing a type of adjacency matrix. Labels 𝐲∈{1,…,K}m𝐲superscript1…𝐾𝑚{\\\\mathbf{y}}\\\\in\\\\{1,\\\\dots,K\\\\}^{m} are provided for a subset of m𝑚m nodes (m≤n𝑚𝑛m\\\\leq n). Without loss of generality, we assume that the first m𝑚m nodes are labeled. The objective is to predict the labels for the n−m𝑛𝑚n-m unlabeled nodes in a transductive setting or to classify newly added nodes in an inductive setting.\n\nGNNs. An L𝐿L-layer GNN fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} with learnable parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta takes the graph 𝒢𝒢\\\\mathcal{G} as input and outputs a prediction for each node with fθ​(𝒢)∈ℝn×Ksubscript𝑓𝜃𝒢superscriptℝ𝑛𝐾f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times K} for multiclass and fθ​(𝒢)∈ℝnsubscript𝑓𝜃𝒢superscriptℝ𝑛f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} for binary classification; the output for a node i𝑖i is denoted by fθ​(𝒢)isubscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝒢𝑖f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\_{i}. We consider GNNs with a linear output layer parameterized using weights 𝑾(L+1)superscript𝑾𝐿1{\\\\bm{W}}^{(L+1)} and refer to [Sec.4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S4 \"4 Experimental Results ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") for details on the used architectures.\n\nInfinite-width GNNs and the Neural Tangent Kernel.\nWhen the width of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} goes to infinity and the parameters are initialized from a Gaussian 𝒩​(0,1/width)𝒩01width\\\\mathcal{N}(0,1/\\\\text{width}), the training dynamics of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} are exactly described by its NTK (Jacot et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib21 \"\"); Arora et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib2 \"\")). For node classification, the NTK of a model fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} is defined between two nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j as Qi​j=𝔼θ​\\[⟨∇θfθ​(𝒢)i,∇θfθ​(𝒢)j⟩\\]subscript𝑄𝑖𝑗subscript𝔼𝜃delimited-\\[\\]subscript∇𝜃subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝒢𝑖subscript∇𝜃subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝒢𝑗Q\\_{ij}=\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\theta}\\[\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\theta}f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\_{i},\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\theta}f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\_{j}\\\\right\\\\rangle\\](Sabanayagam et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib43 \"\")), where the expectation is taken over the parameter initialization.\n\nOn the Equivalence to Support Vector Machines.\nIn the following, we focus on binary node classification with yi∈{±1}subscript𝑦𝑖plus-or-minus1y\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\} and refer to [App.A](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#A1 \"Appendix A Multi-class Label Certification ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") for the multi-class case. We learn the parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta of a GNN by optimizing the soft-margin loss by gradient descent:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | minθ⁡ℒ​(θ,𝐲)=minθ​∑i=1mmax⁡(0,1−yi​fθ​(𝒢)i)+12​C​∥𝐖(L+1)∥22subscript𝜃ℒ𝜃𝐲subscript𝜃superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚01subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝒢𝑖12𝐶subscriptsuperscriptdelimited-∥∥superscript𝐖𝐿122\\\\displaystyle\\\\min\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta,{\\\\mathbf{y}})=\\\\min\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}\\\\max(0,1-y\\_{i}f\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\mathcal{G})\\_{i})+\\\\frac{1}{2C}\\\\lVert{\\\\mathbf{W}}^{(L+1)}\\\\rVert^{2}\\_{2} |  | (1) |\n\nwhere C>0𝐶0C>0 is a regularization constant. In the infinite-width limit, the training dynamics for [Eq.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S2.E1 \"In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") are the same as those of an SVM with fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta}’s NTK as kernel. Thus,\nsolving [Eq.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S2.E1 \"In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")\nis equivalent to solving the dual problem of an SVM without bias (Gosch et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib16 \"\"); Chen et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib8 \"\")):\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | P1⁡(𝐲):min𝜶−∑i=1mαi+12​∑i=1m∑j=1myi​yj​αi​αj​Qi​j​s.t.​  0≤αi≤C​∀i∈\\[m\\]:subscriptP1𝐲subscript𝜶superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚subscript𝛼𝑖12superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝛼𝑗subscript𝑄𝑖𝑗s.t.  0subscript𝛼𝑖𝐶for-all𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚\\\\displaystyle\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}):\\ \\\\min\\_{{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}}-\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}\\\\alpha\\_{i}+\\\\dfrac{1}{2}\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}\\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}y\\_{i}y\\_{j}\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\alpha\\_{j}Q\\_{ij}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\text{s.t.}\\\\,\\\\,0\\\\leq\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\leq C\\\\,\\\\,\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\] |  | (2) |\n\nwhere 𝜶∈ℝm𝜶superscriptℝ𝑚{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m} are the SVM dual variables, and Qi​jsubscript𝑄𝑖𝑗Q\\_{ij} the NTK of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} between nodes i𝑖i and j𝑗j.\nThe solution to [Eq.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S2.E2 \"In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") is not guaranteed to be unique; hence, denote by 𝒮​(𝐲)𝒮𝐲\\\\mathcal{S}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) the set of 𝜶𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}} vectors solving P1⁡(𝐲)subscriptP1𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}).

Concerning the finite-width case, the output difference to the SVM is bounded by 𝒪​(ln⁡ww)𝒪𝑤𝑤\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\frac{\\\\ln w}{\\\\sqrt{w}}) with probability 1−exp⁡(−Ω​(w))1Ω𝑤1-\\\\exp(-\\\\Omega(w)), where w𝑤w denotes the smallest layer-width of the GNN (Gosch et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib16 \"\"); Liu et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib33 \"\")). Thus, for increasing w𝑤w the output difference approaches 00 while the probability approaches 111.\nAs a result, given sufficient width, a guarantee for the infinite-width case will translate to a high-probability guarantee for the finite-width case (see [App.E](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#A5 \"Appendix E Finite-width Model-specific Guarantees ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") for model-specific guarantees).Note that if a finite-width network does not have sufficient width, the certificate becomes incomplete. Thus, we focus on exact certification in the sufficiently wide case.\n\nLabel Poisoning. We assume that before training the adversary 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} has control over the labels of an ϵitalic-ϵ\\\\epsilon-fraction of labeled nodes.

From these, we highlight\nMei & Zhu ( [2015](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib37 \"\")) who focus on SVMs and similar to us, transform the bilevel problem into a single-level one, but only\napproximately solve it with a gradient-based approach and don’t consider label flipping. Regarding label flipping, Biggio et al. ( [2011](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib3 \"\")) and Xiao et al.

The approaches based on differential privacy (Ma et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib35 \"\")), randomized smoothing (Rosenfeld et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib41 \"\"); Lai et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib29 \"\")), and majority voting (Levine & Feizi, [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib30 \"\")) are inherently incomplete. In contrast, similar to us, Gosch et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib16 \"\")) directly solve the bilevel formulation to obtain sample-wise feature poisoning certificates for wide (G)NNs. However, their reformulation it not exact or applicable to the label flipping problem, and they do not provide a collective certificate. We detail the technical differences in [App.F](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#A6 \"Appendix F Comparison to QPCert Gosch et al. (2024) ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\").\n\n## 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning\n\nOur derivation of label flipping certificates for GNNs is fundamentally based on the equivalence with an SVM using the NTK of the corresponding network as its kernel. Concretely, our derivations follow three high-level steps depicted in [Fig.1(b)](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S1.F1.sf2 \"In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"): (i)𝑖(i) we instantiate the bilevel problem in [Eq.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S2.E3 \"In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") for (kernelized) SVMs with a loss describing misclassification and using properties of the SVM’s dual formulation, we transform it into a single-level non-linear optimization problem; (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) we introduce linearizations of the non-linear terms, allowing us to further reformulate the non-linear problem into an equivalent mixed-integer linear program; and (i​i​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖(iii) by choosing the NTK of a network as the kernel, solving the resulting MILP yields a certificate for the corresponding sufficiently-wide NN. In [Sec.3.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.SS1 \"3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") we present our sample-wise certificate for label flipping and then, derive a collective certification strategy in [Sec.3.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.SS2 \"3.2 Collective Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"). We note that the reformulation process requires no approximations or relaxations; hence, the derived certificates are exact. In what follows, we choose an SVM in its dual formulation as our model, hence the model parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta are the dual variables 𝜶𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}. Further, we present the certificates for binary labels yi∈{±1}subscript𝑦𝑖plus-or-minus1y\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\} and discuss the multi-class case in [App.A](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#A1 \"Appendix A Multi-class Label Certification ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\").\n\n### 3.1 Sample-wise Certification\n\nTo obtain a sample-wise certificate, we have to prove that the model prediction for a test node t𝑡t can’t be changed by training on any 𝐲~∈𝒜​(𝐲)~𝐲𝒜𝐲\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\mathbf{y}}). Let 𝜶∗superscript𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}^{\\*} be an optimal solution to the dual problem P1⁡(𝐲)subscriptP1𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) obtained by training on the original labels 𝐲𝐲{\\\\mathbf{y}} and denote by p^t=∑i=1myi​αi∗​Qt​isubscript^𝑝𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚subscript𝑦𝑖superscriptsubscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝑄𝑡𝑖\\\\hat{p}\\_{t}=\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}y\\_{i}\\\\alpha\\_{i}^{\\*}Q\\_{ti} the corresponding SVM’s prediction for t𝑡t. Similary, let 𝜶𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}} be an optimal solution to P1⁡(𝐲~)subscriptP1~𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}) with perturbed labels 𝐲~~𝐲\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}} and the new prediction be pt=∑i=1my~i​αi​Qt​isubscript𝑝𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑚subscript~𝑦𝑖subscript𝛼𝑖subscript𝑄𝑡𝑖p\\_{t}=\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}\\\\alpha\\_{i}Q\\_{ti}. As an SVM assigns class based on the sign of its prediction, the class prediction changes if and only if sign⁡(p^t)⋅pt<0⋅signsubscript^𝑝𝑡subscript𝑝𝑡0\\\\operatorname{sign}(\\\\hat{p}\\_{t})\\\\cdot p\\_{t}<0111In our implementation, we treat the undefined case of p^t⋅pt=0⋅subscript^𝑝𝑡subscript𝑝𝑡0\\\\hat{p}\\_{t}\\\\cdot p\\_{t}=0 as misclassification.. Thus, the bilevel problem\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | P2(𝐲):min𝜶,𝐲~sign(p^t)∑i=1my~iαiQt​is.t.𝐲~∈𝒜(𝐲)∧𝜶∈𝒮(𝐲~)\\\\displaystyle\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}):\\ \\\\min\\_{{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}},\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}}\\ \\\\operatorname{sign}(\\\\hat{p}\\_{t})\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}\\\\alpha\\_{i}Q\\_{ti}\\\\quad s.t.\\\\quad\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\mathbf{y}})\\ \\\\land\\ {\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}) |  | (4) |\n\ncertifies robustness, if the optimal solution is >0absent0>0. However, bilevel problems are notoriously hard to solve (Schmidt & Beck, [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib44 \"\")), making P2⁡(𝐲)subscriptP2𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) intractable in its current form. Now, notice that the inner optimization problem 𝜶∈𝒮​(𝐲~)𝜶𝒮~𝐲{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}) consists of the SVM’s dual problem P1⁡(𝐲~)subscriptP1~𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}), which is convex and fulfills Slater’s condition for every 𝐲~~𝐲\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}} (see [App.B](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#A2 \"Appendix B Slater Condition ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")). Thus, we can replace 𝜶∈𝒮​(𝐲~)𝜶𝒮~𝐲{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}) with P1⁡(𝐲~)subscriptP1~𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}})’s Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to obtain a single-level problem P3⁡(𝐲)subscriptP3𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) that shares the same optimal solutions as P2⁡(𝐲)subscriptP2𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\mathbf{y}})(Dempe & Dutta, [2012](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#bib.bib10 \"\")).\nThe KKT conditions define three sets of constraints. First, stationarity constraints from the derivate of the Lagrangian of P1⁡(𝐲~)subscriptP1~𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}):\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ∀i∈\\[m\\]:∑j=1my~iy~jαjQi​j−1−ui+vi=0\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\]:\\\\quad\\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{j}\\\\alpha\\_{j}Q\\_{ij}-1-u\\_{i}+v\\_{i}=0 |  | (5) |\n\nwhere 𝐮,𝐯∈ℝm𝐮𝐯superscriptℝ𝑚{\\\\mathbf{u}},{\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m} are the Lagrangian dual variables. Secondly, feasibility ranges for all i∈\\[m\\]𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚i\\\\in\\[m\\]: αi≥0,C−αi≥0,ui≥0,vi≥0formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑖0formulae-sequence𝐶subscript𝛼𝑖0formulae-sequencesubscript𝑢𝑖0subscript𝑣𝑖0\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\geq 0,\\\\,\\\\,C-\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\geq 0,\\\\,\\\\,u\\_{i}\\\\geq 0,\\\\,\\\\,v\\_{i}\\\\geq 0, and lastly, the complementary slackness constraints:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ∀i∈\\[m\\]:uiαi=0,vi(C−αi)=0.\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\]:\\\\quad u\\_{i}\\\\alpha\\_{i}=0,\\\\,\\\\,v\\_{i}(C-\\\\alpha\\_{i})=0. |  | (6) |\n\nThus, the resulting single-level optimization problem P3⁡(𝐲)subscriptP3𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) now optimizes over 𝜶,𝐲~,𝐮𝜶~𝐲𝐮{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}},\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}},{\\\\mathbf{u}} and 𝐯𝐯{\\\\mathbf{v}}.\n\nA Mixed-Integer Linear Reformulation.P3⁡(𝐲)subscriptP3𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) is a difficult to solve non-linear problem as [Eq.5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.E5 \"In 3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") defines multilinear constraints and both, the objective and [Eq.6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.E6 \"In 3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") are bilinear. Thus, to make P3⁡(𝐲)subscriptP3𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) tractable, we introduce (exact) linearizations of all non-linearities, as well as linearly model the adversary 𝐲~∈𝒜​(𝐲)~𝐲𝒜𝐲\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\mathbf{y}}).\n\n_(i)𝑖(i) Modeling the adversary:_\nFirst, we have to ensure that the variable 𝐲~∈{−1,1}m~𝐲superscript11𝑚\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\{-1,1\\\\}^{m}.

As the product terms also appear in the stationarity constraints of [Eq.5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2412.00537#S3.E5 \"In 3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), they become bilinear reading ∀i∈\\[m\\],∑j=1my~i​zj​Qi​j−1−ui+vi=0formulae-sequencefor-all𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript~𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑄𝑖𝑗1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖0\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\],\\ \\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}z\\_{j}Q\\_{ij}-1-u\\_{i}+v\\_{i}=0. As the non-linear product terms y~i​zjsubscript~𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑗\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}z\\_{j} in the stationarity constraints are also the multiplication of a binary with a continuous variable, we linearize them following a similar strategy.

      "content": "Machine learning models are vulnerable to data poisoning where adversarial perturbations are applied to the training data to compromise the performance of a model at test time (Goldblum et al., [2023]). In addition,\ndata poisoning has been observed in practice and is recognized as a critical concern for practitioners and enterprises (Kumar et al., [2020]; Grosse et al., [2023]; Cinà et al., [2024])). The practical feasibility was impressively demonstrated by Carlini et al. ( [2024]), who showed that with only $60 USD they could have poisoned several commonly used web-scale datasets.\n\nLabel flipping is a special type of data poisoning where a fraction of the training labels are corrupted, leaving the features unaffected. This type of attack has proven widespread effectivity ranging from classical methods for i.i.d. or graph data (Biggio et al., [2011]; Liu et al., [2019]), to modern\ndeep learning systems for images, text, or\ngraph-based learning (Jha et al., [2023]; Wan et al., [2023]; Lingam et al., [2024]). Exemplary, Lingam et al. ( [2024]) showed that one adversarial label flip could reduce the accuracy of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, [2017]) by over 17%percent1717\\\\%\non a smaller version of Cora-ML (McCallum et al., [2000]). Similarly, [Fig.1(a)]In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") demonstrates for the Karate Club network (Zachary, [1977]) that one label-flip can reduce the accuracy of a GCN by 50%.\n\nAlthough several empirical defenses have been developed to counter label flipping attacks (Zhang et al., [2020]; Paudice et al., [2019]), they remain vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated attacks (Koh et al., [2022]). This highlights the need for _robustness certificates_ which offer formal guarantees that the test predictions remain unaffected under a given perturbation model. However, there are currently no works on certifying label poisoning for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and as a result, little is known about the worst-case (adversarial) robustness of different architectural choices.\nThat a difference in behavior can be expected is motivated in [Fig.1(a)]In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), where exchanging the ReLU in a GCN with an identity function forming a Simplified Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) (Wu et al., [2019]), results in significantly higher worst-case robustness to label flipping for Karate Club.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n(a) Worst-case robustness to one label flip of two GNNs.![Refer to caption](b) Illustration of our label-flipping certificate.\n\nFigure 1: (a) The Karate Club network is visualized with its labeled ( ) and unlabeled ( ) nodes.\nThe adversarial\nlabel flip ( ) calculated by our method outlined in\n(b) provably leads to most node predictions being flipped ( ) for two GNNs (GCN & SGC).\nThe certified accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified nodes that remain robust to the attack.\n\nIn general, robustness certificates can be divided into being exact (also known as complete), i.e., returning the exact adversarial robustness of a model representing its worst-case robustness to a given perturbation model, or incomplete, representing an underestimation of the exact robustness. Complete certificates allow us to characterize and compare the effect different architectural choices have on worst-case robustness as exemplified in [Fig.1(a)]In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), whereas incomplete certificates suffer from having variable tightness for different models, making meaningful comparisons difficult (Li et al., [2023]). Currently, even for i.i.d. data there are no exact poisoning certificates for NNs, and existing approaches to certify label-flipping are limited to randomized smoothing (Rosenfeld et al., [2020]) and partition-based aggregation (Levine & Feizi, [2021]), which offer incomplete guarantees for smoothed or ensembles of classifiers. Thus, adapting these techniques to graphs will not enable us to understand the effect of specific architectural choices for GNNs on their worst-case robustness. The lack of exact certificates can be understood due to the inherent complexity of capturing the effect a change in the training data has on the training dynamics and consequently, is an unsolved problem. This raises the question:\n_is it even possible to compute exact certificates against label poisoning?_\n\nIn this work, we resolve this question by first deriving _exact sample-wise_ robustness certificates for sufficiently wide NNs against label flipping and evaluate them for different GNNs focusing on semi-supervised node classification. Based on our sample-wise derivation we develop an _exact collective_ certification strategy that certifies the entire test set simultaneously. This is of particular importance for poisoning certificates, as a model is usually trained once on a given training set and then evaluated. Consequently, an attacker can only choose one perturbation to the training set targeting the performance on all test points. To capture the effect of label flipping on the training process of a network, our approach takes inspiration from Gosch et al. ( [2024]) and makes use of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of different GNNs (Sabanayagam et al., [2023]), which precisely characterizes the training dynamics of sufficiently wide NNs (Arora et al., [2019]). Concretely, we leverage the equivalence of a wide NN trained using the soft-margin loss with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that uses the NTK of the network as its kernel (Chen et al., [2021]). This allows us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem describing label flipping as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) yielding a certificate for wide NNs as illustrated in [Fig.1(b)]In Fig. 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"). As the MILP scales with the number of labeled data, our method is a good fit to certify GNNs for semi-supervised node-classification on graphs, due to the usually encountered sparse labeling.\nWhile Gosch et al. ( [2024]) were the first to use the NTK\nto derive model-specific poisoning certificates, their work is limited to feature perturbations and incomplete sample-wise certification.\nThus, our contributions are:\n\n(i) We derive the _first exact robustness certificates_ for NNs against label flipping. Next to sample-wise certificates ( [Sec.3.1]Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")), we develop _exact collective certificates_ ( [Sec.3.2]Collective Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")) particularly important for characterizing the worst-case robustness of different architectures to label poisoning. Concretely, our certificates apply to infinite-width NNs and hold with high probability for wide finite-width NNs.\n\n(ii) We apply our certificates to a wide-range of GNNs for node-classification on both, real and synthetic data ( [Sec.4]Experimental Results ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\")). Thereby, we establish that worst-case robustness hierarchies are highly data-dependent, and quantify the effect of different graph properties and architectural choices (e.g., activations, depth, skip-connections)\non worst-case robustness.\n\n(iii) Using the collective certificate, we uncover a surprising phenomenon: across all datasets, most architectures show a worst-case robustness plateaus for intermediate attack budgets so far not observed with adversarial attacks (Lingam et al., [2024]).\n\n(iv) Beyond (wide) NNs, our MILP reformulation is valid for SVMs with arbitrary kernel choices. Thus, it is the first certificate for kernelized SVMs against label flipping.\n\nNotation.\nWe use bold upper and lowercase letters to denote a matrix 𝐀𝐀{\\\\mathbf{A}} and vector 𝐚𝐚{\\\\mathbf{a}}, respectively.

Thus, for increasing w𝑤w the output difference approaches 00 while the probability approaches 111.\nAs a result, given sufficient width, a guarantee for the infinite-width case will translate to a high-probability guarantee for the finite-width case (see [App.E]Appendix E Finite-width Model-specific Guarantees ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") for model-specific guarantees).Note that if a finite-width network does not have sufficient width, the certificate becomes incomplete. Thus, we focus on exact certification in the sufficiently wide case.\n\nLabel Poisoning.

From these, we highlight\nMei & Zhu ( [2015])) who focus on SVMs and similar to us, transform the bilevel problem into a single-level one, but only\napproximately solve it with a gradient-based approach and don’t consider label flipping. Regarding label flipping, Biggio et al. ( [2011]) and Xiao et al. ( [2012]) develop attacks for SVMs solving [Eq.3]In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") with non-gradient based heuristics; Lingam et al. ( [2024]) create an attack for GNNs by solving [Eq.3]In 2 Problem Setup and Preliminaries ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") with a regression loss, replacing the GCN with a surrogate model given by the NTK.\nConcerning _certificates_ for data poisoning, there are only few works with none providing exact guarantees. The approaches based on differential privacy (Ma et al., [2019]), randomized smoothing (Rosenfeld et al., [2020]; Lai et al., [2024]), and majority voting (Levine & Feizi, [2021]) are inherently incomplete. In contrast, similar to us, Gosch et al. ( [2024]) directly solve the bilevel formulation to obtain sample-wise feature poisoning certificates for wide (G)NNs. However, their reformulation it not exact or applicable to the label flipping problem, and they do not provide a collective certificate. We detail the technical differences in [App.F]Appendix F Comparison to QPCert Gosch et al. (2024) ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\").",

In [Sec.3.1]Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\") we present our sample-wise certificate for label flipping and then, derive a collective certification strategy in [Sec.3.2]Collective Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"). We note that the reformulation process requires no approximations or relaxations; hence, the derived certificates are exact. In what follows, we choose an SVM in its dual formulation as our model, hence the model parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta are the dual variables 𝜶𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}.

First, stationarity constraints from the derivate of the Lagrangian of P1⁡(𝐲~)subscriptP1~𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}):\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ∀i∈\\[m\\]:∑j=1my~iy~jαjQi​j−1−ui+vi=0\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\]:\\\\quad\\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{j}\\\\alpha\\_{j}Q\\_{ij}-1-u\\_{i}+v\\_{i}=0 |  | (5) |\n\nwhere 𝐮,𝐯∈ℝm𝐮𝐯superscriptℝ𝑚{\\\\mathbf{u}},{\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m} are the Lagrangian dual variables.

Thus, to make P3⁡(𝐲)subscriptP3𝐲\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\mathbf{y}}) tractable, we introduce (exact) linearizations of all non-linearities, as well as linearly model the adversary 𝐲~∈𝒜​(𝐲)~𝐲𝒜𝐲\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\mathbf{y}}).\n\n_(i)𝑖(i) Modeling the adversary:_\nFirst, we have to ensure that the variable 𝐲~∈{−1,1}m~𝐲superscript11𝑚\\\\tilde{{\\\\mathbf{y}}}\\\\in\\\\{-1,1\\\\}^{m}.

As the product terms also appear in the stationarity constraints of [Eq.5]In 3.1 Sample-wise Certification ‣ 3 LabelCert for Label Poisoning ‣ Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning\"), they become bilinear reading ∀i∈\\[m\\],∑j=1my~i​zj​Qi​j−1−ui+vi=0formulae-sequencefor-all𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚superscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript~𝑦𝑖subscript𝑧𝑗subscript𝑄𝑖𝑗1subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑣𝑖0\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\],\\ \\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}\\\\tilde{y}\\_{i}z\\_{j}Q\\_{ij}-1-u\\_{i}+v\\_{i}=0.

            "content": "Numerous works showcase the vulnerability of modern machine learning models to data poisoning, where adversarial changes are made to the training data (Biggio et al., [2012]); Muñoz-González et al., [2017]); Zügner and Günnemann, [2019]); Wan et al., [2023])), as well as backdoor attacks affecting both training and test sets (Goldblum et al., [2023])).\nEmpirical defenses against such threats are continually at risk of being compromised by\nfuture attacks\n(Koh et al., [2022]); Suciu et al., [2018])). This motivates the development of _robustness certificates_,\nwhich provide formal guarantees that the prediction for a given test data point remains unchanged under an assumed perturbation model.\n\nRobustness certificates can be categorized as providing deterministic or probabilistic guarantees, and as being white box, i.e. developed for a particular model, or black box (model-agnostic). While each approach has its strengths and applications (Li et al., [2023])),\nwe focus on white-box certificates as they can provide a more direct understanding into the worst-case robustness behavior of commonly used models and\narchitectural choices (Tjeng et al., [2019]); Mao et al., [2024]); Banerjee et al., [2024])). The literature on poisoning certificates is less developed than certifying against test-time (evasion) attacks and we provide an overview and categorization in [Table1]In 1 Introduction ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Notably, white-box certificates are currently available only for decision trees (Drews et al., [2020])), nearest neighbor algorithms (Jia et al., [2022])), and naive Bayes classification (Bian et al., [2024])). In the case of Neural Networks (NNs), the main challenge in white-box poisoning certification comes from capturing their complex training dynamics. As a result, the current literature reveals that deriving white-box poisoning certificates for NNs, and by extension Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), is still an unsolved problem, raising the question if such certificates can at all be practically computed.\n\nTable 1: Representative selection of data poisoning and backdoor attack certificates. To the best of our knowledge, it contains all white-box works. Our work presents the first white-box certificate applicable to (graph) neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Poisoning refers to (purely) training-time attacks. A backdoor attack refers to joint training-time and test-time perturbations. Certificates apply to different attack types: (i)𝑖(i) Clean-label: modifies the features of the training data; (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii) Label-flipping: modifies the labels of the training data; (i​i​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖(iii) Joint: modifies both features and labels; (i​v)𝑖𝑣(iv) General attack: allows (arbitrary) insertion/deletion, i.e., like (i​i​i)𝑖𝑖𝑖(iii) but dataset size doesn’t need to be constant; (v)𝑣(v) Node injection: particular to graph learning, refers to adding nodes with arbitrary features and malicious edges into the graph. It is most related to (i​v)𝑖𝑣(iv) but does not allow deletion and can’t be compared with (i)𝑖(i) and (i​i)𝑖𝑖(ii).

Concretely, poisoning can be modeled as a bilevel optimization problem over the training data 𝒟𝒟\\\\mathcal{D} that includes training on 𝒟𝒟\\\\mathcal{D} as its inner subproblem. To overcome the challenge of capturing the\ncomplex training dynamics of NNs,\nwe consider the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) that characterizes the training dynamics of sufficiently wide NNs under gradient flow (Jacot et al., [2018]); Arora et al., [2019])). In particular, we leverage the equivalence between NNs trained using the soft-margin loss and standard soft-margin\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Illustration of our poisoning certificate.\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) with the NN’s NTKs as kernel matrix  (Chen et al., [2021])).\nUsing this equivalence, we introduce a novel reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem\nas a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that allows to certify test datapoints against poisoning as well as backdoor attacks for sufficiently wide NNs (see [Fig.1]In 1 Introduction ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")). Although our framework applies to wide NNs in general, solving the MILP scales with the number of labeled training samples. Thus, it is a natural fit for semi-supervised learning tasks, where one can take advantage of the low labeling rate. As a result, we focus on semi-supervised node classification in graphs and use our framework with corresponding NTKs (Sabanayagam et al., [2023])) of various GNNs. Our contributions are:\n\n(i) We are the first to certify GNNs in node-classification tasks against poisoning and backdoor attacks targeting node features. Our certification framework called QPCert is introduced in [Sec.3]QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and leverages the NTK to capture the complex training-dynamics of GNNs. Further, it can be applied to NNs in general and thus, it represents the first approach on white-box poisoning certificates for NNs.\n\n(ii) Enabled by the white-box nature of our certificate, we use Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs) as well as real data, to conduct the first study into the role of graph data and architectural components on the worst-case robustness of widely used GNN architectures against data poisoning and backdoor attacks (see [Sec.4]Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")). We focus on convolution-based and PageRank-based GNNs and as a byproduct, contribute the derivation of the closed-form NTK for Approximate Personalized Propagation of Neural Predictions network (APPNP) (Gasteiger et al., [2019])) in [App.B]Appendix B Derivation of NTK for (A)PPNP ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\").\n\n(iii) We contribute a reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem describing poisoning as a MILP when instantiated with kernelized SVMs, allowing for white-box certification of SVMs. While we focus on the NTK as kernel, our strategy can be transferred to arbitrary kernel choices.\n\nNotation.\nWe represent matrices and vectors with boldfaced upper and lowercase letters, respectively. visubscript𝑣𝑖v\\_{i} and Mi​jsubscript𝑀𝑖𝑗M\\_{ij} denote i𝑖i-th and i​j𝑖𝑗ij-th entries of the vector 𝐯𝐯{\\\\mathbf{v}} and matrix 𝐌𝐌{\\\\mathbf{M}}, respectively.\ni𝑖i-th row of matrix 𝐌𝐌{\\\\mathbf{M}} is 𝐌isubscript𝐌𝑖{\\\\mathbf{M}}\\_{i}.\n𝐈nsubscript𝐈𝑛{\\\\mathbf{I}}\\_{n} is the identity matrix of size n𝑛n and 𝟏n×nsubscript1𝑛𝑛\\\\mathbf{1}\\_{n\\\\times n} is the matrix of all 111s with size n×n𝑛𝑛n\\\\times n.\n⟨𝐚,𝐛⟩𝐚𝐛\\\\left\\\\langle{\\\\mathbf{a}},{\\\\mathbf{b}}\\\\right\\\\rangle denotes scalar product between 𝐚𝐚{\\\\mathbf{a}} and 𝐛𝐛{\\\\mathbf{b}}.\nWe use ∥.∥2\\\\lVert.\\\\rVert\\_{2} for vector Euclidean norm and matrix Frobenius norm, 𝟙\\[.\\]\\\\mathbbm{1}\\[.\\] for indicator function, 𝔼\\[.\\]\\\\underset{}{\\\\mathbb{E}}\\\\left\\[.\\\\right\\] for expectation, ⊙direct-product\\\\odot for the Hadamard product and the ceil operator ⌈z⌉𝑧\\\\lceil z\\\\rceil for the smallest integer ≥zabsent𝑧\\\\geq z.\n\\[n\\]delimited-\\[\\]𝑛\\[n\\] denotes {1,2,…,n}12…𝑛\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\}.",

Thus, in this section, we develop a general methodology to reformulate the bilevel (sample-wise) certification problem for kernelized SVMs as a mixed-integer linear program, making certification tractable through the use of highly efficient modern MILP solvers such as Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization, LLC, [2023])) or CPLEX (Cplex, [2009])).

Now, we can state the following proposition proved in [App.F]Appendix F Proof of Proposition 1 ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\").\n\n###### Proposition 1.\n\nProblem P1⁡(𝐐~)subscriptP1~𝐐\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) given by [Eq.2]In 2 Preliminaries ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") is convex and satisfies strong Slater’s constraint.\nConsequently, the single-level optimization problem P3⁡(𝐐)subscriptP3𝐐\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) arising from P2⁡(𝐐)subscriptP2𝐐\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) by replacing 𝛂∈𝒮​(𝐐~)𝛂𝒮~𝐐{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) with [Eqs.5]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"), [6]Eq. 6 ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and [7]Eq. 7 ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") has the same globally optimal solutions as P2⁡(𝐐)subscriptP2𝐐\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\bm{Q}}).\n\nA mixed-integer linear reformulation. The computational bottleneck of P3⁡(𝑸~)subscriptP3~𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) are the non-linear product terms between continuous variables in the attack objective as well as in [Eqs.7]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and [5]Eq. 5 ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"), making P3⁡(𝑸~)subscriptP3~𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) a bilinear problem. Thus, we describe in the following how P3⁡(𝑸~)subscriptP3~𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) can be transformed into a MILP. First,\nthe complementary slackness constraints can be linearized by recognizing that they have a combinatorial structure. In particular, ui=0subscript𝑢𝑖0u\\_{i}=0 if αi>0subscript𝛼𝑖0\\\\alpha\\_{i}>0 and vi=0subscript𝑣𝑖0v\\_{i}=0 if αi<Csubscript𝛼𝑖𝐶\\\\alpha\\_{i}<C. Thus, introducing binary integer variables 𝐬𝐬{\\\\mathbf{s}} and 𝐭∈{0,1}m𝐭superscript01𝑚{\\\\mathbf{t}}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{m}, we reformulate the constraints in [Eq.7]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") with big-M𝑀M constraints as\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ∀i∈\\[m\\]::for-all𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚absent\\\\displaystyle\\\\forall i\\\\in\\[m\\]:\\\\quad | ui≤Mui​si,αi≤C​(1−si),si∈{0,1},formulae-sequencesubscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑀subscript𝑢𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖formulae-sequencesubscript𝛼𝑖𝐶1subscript𝑠𝑖subscript𝑠𝑖01\\\\displaystyle u\\_{i}\\\\leq M\\_{u\\_{i}}s\\_{i},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\leq C(1-s\\_{i}),\\\\,\\\\,s\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}, |  | (8) |\n|  |  | vi≤Mvi​ti,C−αi≤C​(1−ti),ti∈{0,1}formulae-sequencesubscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑀subscript𝑣𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖formulae-sequence𝐶subscript𝛼𝑖𝐶1subscript𝑡𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖01\\\\displaystyle v\\_{i}\\\\leq M\\_{v\\_{i}}t\\_{i},\\\\,\\\\,C-\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\leq C(1-t\\_{i}),\\\\,\\\\,t\\_{i}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\} |  |\n\nwhere Muisubscript𝑀subscript𝑢𝑖M\\_{u\\_{i}} and Mvisubscript𝑀subscript𝑣𝑖M\\_{v\\_{i}} are positive constants. In general, verifying that a certain choice of big-M𝑀Ms results in a valid (mixed-integer) reformulation of the complementary constraints [Eq.7]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"), i.e., such that no optimal solution to the original bilevel problem is cut off, is at least as hard as solving the bilevel problem itself (Kleinert et al., [2020])). This is problematic as heuristic choices can lead to suboptimal solutions to the original problem (Pineda and Morales, [2019])). However, additional structure provided by P1⁡(𝑸~)subscriptP1~𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{1}}(\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}) and P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) together with insights into the optimal solution set allow us to derive valid and small Muisubscript𝑀subscript𝑢𝑖M\\_{u\\_{i}} and Mvisubscript𝑀subscript𝑣𝑖M\\_{v\\_{i}} for all i∈\\[m\\]𝑖delimited-\\[\\]𝑚i\\\\in\\[m\\].\n\nConcretely, the adversary 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} can only make a bounded change to 𝒢𝒢\\\\mathcal{G}. Thus, the element-wise difference of any 𝑸~∈𝒜​(𝑸)~𝑸𝒜𝑸\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\bm{Q}}) to 𝑸𝑸{\\\\bm{Q}} will be bounded. As a result, there exist element-wise upper and lower bounds Q~i​jL≤Q~i​j≤Q~i​jUsubscriptsuperscript~𝑄𝐿𝑖𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗superscriptsubscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗𝑈\\\\widetilde{Q}^{L}\\_{ij}\\\\leq\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij}\\\\leq\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij}^{U} for all i,j∈\\[m\\]∪{t}𝑖𝑗delimited-\\[\\]𝑚𝑡i,j\\\\in\\[m\\]\\\\cup\\\\{t\\\\} and valid for any 𝑸~∈𝒜​(𝑸)~𝑸𝒜𝑸\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}({\\\\bm{Q}}). In [Sec.3.1]QPCert for GNNs through their corresponding NTKs ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") we derive concrete lower and upper bounds for the NTKs corresponding to different common GNNs. This, together with 0≤αi≤C0subscript𝛼𝑖𝐶0\\\\leq\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\leq C, allows us to lower and upper bound ∑j=1myi​yj​αj​Q~i​jsuperscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗\\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}y\\_{i}y\\_{j}\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij} in [Eq.5]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Now, given an optimal solution (𝜶∗,𝑸~∗,𝐮∗,𝐯∗)superscript𝜶superscript~𝑸superscript𝐮superscript𝐯({\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}^{\\*},\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}^{\\*},{\\\\mathbf{u}}^{\\*},{\\\\mathbf{v}}^{\\*}) to P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}), observe that either ui∗superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖u\\_{i}^{\\*} or vi∗superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖v\\_{i}^{\\*} are zero, or can be freely varied between any positive values as long as [Eq.5]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") is satisfied without changing the objective value or any other variable. As a result, one can use the lower and upper bounds on ∑j=1myi​yj​αj​Q~i​jsuperscriptsubscript𝑗1𝑚subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑦𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗\\\\sum\\_{j=1}^{m}y\\_{i}y\\_{j}\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij} to find the minimal value range necessary and sufficient for uisubscript𝑢𝑖u\\_{i} and visubscript𝑣𝑖v\\_{i}, such that [Eq.5]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") can always be satisfied for any 𝜶∗superscript𝜶{\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}}^{\\*} and 𝑸~∗superscript~𝑸\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}^{\\*}. Consequently, only redundant solutions regarding large ui∗superscriptsubscript𝑢𝑖u\\_{i}^{\\*} and vi∗superscriptsubscript𝑣𝑖v\\_{i}^{\\*} will be cut off and the optimal solution value stays the same as for P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}), not affecting the certification. The exact Muisubscript𝑀subscript𝑢𝑖M\\_{u\\_{i}} and Mvisubscript𝑀subscript𝑣𝑖M\\_{v\\_{i}} depend on the signs of the involved yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\\_{i} and yjsubscript𝑦𝑗y\\_{j} and are derived in [App.G]Appendix G Setting big-𝑀 constraints ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\").\n\nNow, the remaining non-linearities come from the product terms αi​Q~i​jsubscript𝛼𝑖subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗\\\\alpha\\_{i}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij}. We approach this by first introducing new variables Zi​jsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij} for all i,j∈\\[m\\]∪{t}𝑖𝑗delimited-\\[\\]𝑚𝑡i,j\\\\in\\[m\\]\\\\cup\\\\{t\\\\} and set Zi​j=αj​Q~i​jsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}=\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij}. Then, we replace all product terms αj​Q~i​jsubscript𝛼𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij} in [Eq.5]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and in the objective in [Eq.4]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") with Zi​jsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}. This alone has not changed the fact that the problem is bilinear, only that the bilinear terms have now moved to the definition of Zi​jsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}. However, we have access to lower and upper bounds on 𝑸~i​jsubscript~𝑸𝑖𝑗\\\\widetilde{{\\\\bm{Q}}}\\_{ij}. Thus, replacing Zi​j=αj​Q~i​jsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscript~𝑄𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}=\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}\\_{ij} with linear constraints Zi​j≤αj​Q~i​jUsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscriptsuperscript~𝑄𝑈𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}\\\\leq\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}^{U}\\_{ij} and Zi​j≥αj​Q~i​jLsubscript𝑍𝑖𝑗subscript𝛼𝑗subscriptsuperscript~𝑄𝐿𝑖𝑗Z\\_{ij}\\\\geq\\\\alpha\\_{j}\\\\widetilde{Q}^{L}\\_{ij} results in a relaxation to P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}).

As a first step, we introduce the NTKs for the GNNs of interest before deriving the bounds.\nWhile Sabanayagam et al.

We find that changing C𝐶C has little effect on the accuracy but can strongly affect the robustness of different architectures. Other parameters on CSBM and all parameters on real-world datasets are set using 4-CV (see [Sec.H.2]H.2 Architectures. ‣ Appendix H Additional experimental details ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") for details). The SVM quadratic dual problem is solved using QPLayer (Bambade et al., [2023])), a differentiable quadratic programming solver. Thus, for evaluating tightness, we use APGD (Croce and Hein, [2020])) with their reported hyperparameters as attack, but differentiate through the learning process (QPLayer).\n\nAdversarial evaluation settings.\nWe categorize four settings of interest. (1) _Poison Labeled (PL)_: The adversary 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} can potentially poison the labeled data 𝒱Lsubscript𝒱𝐿\\\\mathcal{V}\\_{L}. (2) _Poison Unlabeled (PU):_ Especially interesting in a semi-supervised setting is the scenario when 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} can poison the unlabeled data 𝒱Usubscript𝒱𝑈\\\\mathcal{V}\\_{U}, while the labeled data, usually representing a small curated set of high quality, is known to be clean (Shejwalkar et al., [2023])). (3) _Backdoor Labeled (BL):_ Like (1)1(1) but the test node is also controlled by 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A}. (4) _Backdoor Unlabeled (BU):_ Like (2)2(2) but again, the test node is controlled by 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A}. Settings (1)1(1) and (2)2(2) are evaluated transductively, i.e. on the unlabeled nodes 𝒱Usubscript𝒱𝑈\\\\mathcal{V}\\_{U} already known at training time.\nNote that this means for (2)2(2) that some test nodes may be corrupted. For the backdoor attack settings (3)3(3) and (4)4(4) the test node is removed from the graph during training and added inductively at test time. The size of the untrusted potential adversarial node set 𝒰𝒰\\\\mathcal{U} is set in percentage pa​d​v∈{0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1}subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣0.010.020.050.10.20.51p\\_{adv}\\\\in\\\\{0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1\\\\} of the scenario-dependent attackable node set and resampled for each seed.

Our main evaluation metric is certified accuracy, referring to the percentage of correctly classified nodes without attack that are provably robust against data poisoning / backdoor attacks of the assumed adversary 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A}. We note as we are the first work to study white-box certificates for clean-label attacks\non node features in graphs in general, there\nis no baseline prior work.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)P​L𝑃𝐿PL, pa​d​v=1subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣1p\\_{adv}=1![Refer to caption](b)P​L𝑃𝐿PL, pa​d​v=0.1subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣0.1p\\_{adv}=0.1\n\nFigure 2: Poison Labeled (P​L)𝑃𝐿(PL): Cora-MLb\n\nNon-trivial certificates or On the importance of graph information.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of our certificates in providing non-trivial robustness guarantees. Consider the P​L𝑃𝐿PL setting where 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} can poison all labeled nodes (pa​d​v=1subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣1p\\_{adv}=1) for which a trivial certificate would return 00% certified accuracy. [Fig.2(a)]In Fig. 2 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") proves that QPcert returns non-trivial guarantees. Further, it highlights an interesting insight: All GNNs have significantly better worst-case robustness behavior than the certified accuracy of an\nMLP. Thus, leveraging the graph connectivity, significantly improves their certified accuracy, even when faced with perturbations on all labeled nodes. [Sec.I.1]I.1 Evaluating QPCert and importance of graph information ‣ Appendix I Additional Results: CSBM ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") shows a similar result for CSBM establishing that this behavior is not dataset-specific.

Again, QPCert provides non-trivial certified robustness beyond the MLP baseline. All GNNs show certified accuracy beyond the one of an MLP persisting until relatively strong perturbations (δ≥0.2𝛿0.2\\\\delta\\\\geq 0.2), with a similar picture for Cora-MLb in\n[Fig.3(c)]In Fig. 3 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and investigated in depth for a GCN in [Fig.4(a)]In Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and other architectures in [Sec.I.1]I.1 Evaluating QPCert and importance of graph information ‣ Appendix I Additional Results: CSBM ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Note that due to the transductive setting in P​U𝑃𝑈PU, a pa​d​vsubscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣p\\_{adv} fraction of test nodes is perturbed, explaining the small drop in certified accuracy for MLP. Concerning backdoor attacks on unlabeled nodes [Figs.3(b)]In Fig. 3 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and [3(d)]Fig. 3(d) ‣ Fig. 3 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") show that GNNs show significantly better certified robustness than an MLP, even if MLP training is not affected by 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A}. We observe similar results for a B​L𝐵𝐿BL setting in [Sec.I.1]I.1 Evaluating QPCert and importance of graph information ‣ Appendix I Additional Results: CSBM ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") and [Sec.J.1]J.1 Evaluating QPCert ‣ Appendix J Additional results: Cora-MLb ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). These results show that leveraging graph information significantly improves certified accuracy across all considered attack settings. For Cora-ML we refer to [App.K]Appendix K Additional results: Cora-ML ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Note that a comparison across architecture can be affected by the certificate’s tightness and we hypothesize that the high worst-case robustness of SGC compared to other models may be due to the certificate being tighter ( [Theorem2]Theorem 2 (NTK bounds are tight). ‣ 3.1 QPCert for GNNs through their corresponding NTKs ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")). However, this still allows us to derive architectural insights for a specific GNN.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)CSBM: P​U𝑃𝑈PU![Refer to caption](b)CSBM: B​U𝐵𝑈BU![Refer to caption](c)Cora-MLb: P​U𝑃𝑈PU![Refer to caption](d)Cora-MLb: B​U𝐵𝑈BU\n\nFigure 3: Certifiable robustness for different (G)NNs in Poisoning Unlabeled (P​U)𝑃𝑈(PU) and Backdoor Unlabeled (B​U)𝐵𝑈(BU) setting. pa​d​v=0.2subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣0.2p\\_{adv}=0.2 for CSBM and pa​d​v=0.1subscript𝑝𝑎𝑑𝑣0.1p\\_{adv}=0.1 for Cora-MLb.\n\nOn graph connectivity and architectural insights. We exemplify study directions enabled through our certification framework. By leveraging CSBMs, we study the effect of graph connectivity in the poisoning unlabeled setting in [Fig.4(b)]In Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") for GCN. Interestingly, we observe an inflection point at perturbation strength δ=0.05𝛿0.05\\\\delta=0.05, where higher connectivity leads to higher certified accuracy against small perturbations, whereas higher connectivity significantly worsens certified accuracy for strong perturbations.\nThese trends are consistent across various architectures and attack settings ( [Sec.I.2]I.2 On graph connectivity and architectural insights ‣ Appendix I Additional Results: CSBM ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")).\n\nSecondly, we study the effect of different α𝛼\\\\alpha choices in APPNP on its certified accuracy in poison labeled setting in [Fig.4(c)]In Fig. 4 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Interestingly, it also shows an inflection point in the perturbation strength (δ=0.1𝛿0.1\\\\delta=0.1), where higher α𝛼\\\\alpha increases the provable robustness for larger δ𝛿\\\\delta, whereas worsens the provable robustness for smaller δ𝛿\\\\delta in Cora-MLb. Notably, this phenomenon is unique to the P​U𝑃𝑈PU setting (see [Sec.J.2]J.2 APPNP ‣ Appendix J Additional results: Cora-MLb ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")) and is similarly observed in CSBM as shown in [Sec.I.2]I.2 On graph connectivity and architectural insights ‣ Appendix I Additional Results: CSBM ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"). Although this setup seems to be similar to the connectivity analysis, it is different as the α𝛼\\\\alpha in APPNP realizes weighted adjacency rather than changing the connectivity of the graph, that is, increasing or decreasing the number of edges in the graph.\nWe compare different normalization choices for 𝐒𝐒{\\\\mathbf{S}} in GCN and SGC in [Sec.J.3]J.3 Symmetric vs. row normalization of the adjacency matrix ‣ Appendix J Additional results: Cora-MLb ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\").\nThrough these analyses, it is significant to note that our certification framework enables informed architectural choices from the perspective of robustness.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)GCN (CSBM, P​U𝑃𝑈PU) ![Refer to caption](b)CSBM: P​U𝑃𝑈PU\n\n![Refer to caption](c)Cora-MLb: P​U𝑃𝑈PU![Refer to caption](d)CSBM: P​U𝑃𝑈PU\n\nFigure 4: (a) Certified accuracy gain: difference of certified accuracy between GCN and MLP.

While theoretically, the NTK bounds are tight ( [Theorem2]Theorem 2 (NTK bounds are tight). ‣ 3.1 QPCert for GNNs through their corresponding NTKs ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")), the approach of deriving element-wise bounds on 𝑸𝑸{\\\\bm{Q}} to model 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} leading to a relaxation of P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) can explain the gap between provable robustness and empirical attack. Thus, we are excited about opportunities for future work to improve our approach for modeling 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A} in the MILP P​(𝑸)𝑃𝑸P({\\\\bm{Q}}).\n\nIs QPCert deterministic or probabilistic?\nOur certification framework is inherently deterministic, offering deterministic guarantees for kernelized SVMs using the NTK as the kernel. When the width of a NN approaches infinity, QPCert provides a deterministic robustness guarantee for the NN due to the exact equivalence between an SVM with the NN’s NTK as kernel and the infinitely wide NN. For sufficiently wide but finite-width NNs this equivalence holds with high probability (Chen et al., [2021])), making our certificate probabilistic in this context. However, note that this high-probability guarantee is qualitatively different from and advantageous compared to other methods such as randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., [2019])), in which the certification approach itself is probabilistic and heavily relies on the number of samplings and thus, inherently introduces randomness.\n\nGenerality of QPCert.\nWhile we focus on (G)NNs for graph data, our framework enables white-box poisoning certification of NNs on any data domain.\nFurther, it allows for certifying general kernelized SVMs for arbitrary kernel choices if respective kernel bounds as in [Sec.3.1]QPCert for GNNs through their corresponding NTKs ‣ 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") are derived. To the best of our knowledge, this makes our work the first white-box poisoning certificate for kernelized SVMs.\nMoreover, the reformulation of the bilevel problem to MILP is directly applicable to any quadratic program that satisfies strong Slater’s constraint and certain bounds on the involved variables, hence the name QPCert. Thus extensions to certify quadratic programming layers in NN (Amos and Kolter, [2017])) or other quadratic learners are thinkable.\nTherefore, we believe that our work opens up numerous new avenues of research into the provable robustness against data poisoning.\n\nPerturbation model. We study semi-verified learning (Charikar et al., [2017])). This is particularly interesting for semi-supervised settings, where often a small fraction of nodes are manually verified and labeled (Shejwalkar et al., [2023])), or when learning from the crowd Meister and Valiant ( [2018])); Zeng and Shen ( [2023])). However, this may produce overly pessimistic bounds when large fractions of the training data are unverified, but the adversary can only control a small part of it. We study clean-label attacks bounded by ℓpsubscriptℓ𝑝\\\\ell\\_{p}-threat models instead of arbitrary perturbations to nodes controlled by 𝒜𝒜\\\\mathcal{A}. Goldblum et al. ( [2023])) distinctively names studying bounded clean-label attacks as an open problem, as most works assume unrealistically large input perturbations.

Most works on poisoning certification work with so-called ‘general attacks’ allowing arbitrary modifications of data controlled by the adversary. In the setting studied in [Fig.2(a)]In Fig. 2 ‣ 4 Experimental results ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\"), this would always lead to 00 certified accuracy and being unable to provide non-trivial guarantees.\n\nRelated work.\nThere is little literature on white-box poisoning certificates (see [Table1]In 1 Introduction ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\")), and existing techniques (Drews et al., [2020]); Meyer et al., [2021]); Jia et al., [2022]); Bian et al., [2024])) cannot be extended to NNs. We summarize the most important related work and refer to [App.M]Appendix M Related works ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") for more details. The bilevel problem [Eq.3]In 3 QPCert: Our certification framework ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\") is investigated by several works in the context of developing a poisoning attack or empirical defense, including for SVMs (Biggio et al., [2012]); Xiao et al., [2015]); Koh and Liang, [2017]); Jagielski et al., [2018])). Notably Mei and Zhu ( [2015])) reformulate the bilevel problem P2⁡(𝑸)subscriptP2𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{2}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) for SVMs to a bilinear single-level problem similar to P3⁡(𝑸)subscriptP3𝑸\\\\operatorname\\*{P\\_{3}}({\\\\bm{Q}}) but only solve it heuristically for attack generation and do not realize the possibility of a MILP reformulation and certification. There are no poisoning certificates for clean-label attacks against GNNs. (Lai et al., [2024])) is the only work on poisoning certification of GNNs, but differ incomparably in their threat model and are black-box as well as not applicable to backdoors. Lingam et al. ( [2024])) develops a label poisoning attack for GNNs using the bilevel problem with a regression objective and including NTKs as surrogate models. We note that (Steinhardt et al., [2017])) develops statistical bounds on the loss that are not applicable to certify classification. Robustness to data poisoning can be related to protection of privacy (Ma et al., [2019])), but may affect fairness (Ma et al., [2022])). We discuss the broader impact in [App.L]Appendix L Broader impact ‣ Provable Robustness of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks\").\n\nConclusion.\nWe derive the first white-box poisoning certificate framework for NNs through their NTKs and SVM, and apply it to node classification with GNNs.

This new subfield has attracted an increasing amount of interest, leading to the development of numerous methods (Wu et al., [2019])). However, several earlier works have noted issues with existing standard benchmarks, which make it difficult to rigorously compare results and accurately distinguish between the performance of competing architectures (Shchur et al., [2018]); Klicpera et al., [2018])).\n\nOur primary focus is semi-supervised node classification: given labels of a small subset of nodes (typically 1–5%) and features of all nodes, as well as their connectivity information, the task is to predict all other labels. This setup is often used to assess the performance of various Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures (Kipf & Welling, [2016a]); Veličković et al., [2017])). These methods are usually evaluated on three citation network datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) introduced by Yang et al ( [2016])). Unfortunately, different training splits are used across studies, which makes comparisons challenging, especially since the performance on this task is very sensitive to the choice of training split (Shchur et al., [2018])). Furthermore, all three benchmarks are derived from the same domain, with similar structural properties. In contrast, Wiki-CS has a much higher connectivity rate, hence it provides a different kind of distribution for these methods to be tested on.\n\nSimilar datasets have also been used in single-relation link prediction (Kipf & Welling, [2016b]); Haonan et al., [2019])).

          "3 The Dataset": {
            "content": "### 3.1 Article Selection and Label Generation\n\nWe processed Wikipedia datadumps from August 2019 to extract a subgraph where accurate class labels could be provided, based on the categories of each article. Unfortunately, these category tags were not suitable for direct use as class labels, as most of them are highly specific and inconsistently applied to a small number of pages—there were around 1.5 million different categories defined on the 6 million pages, at the time of the snapshot that we used.\n\nThis problem was mitigated by using the category sanitizer tool made available by Boldi & Monti ( [2016])), with some modifications. Their method relies on the subcategory relation to aggregate articles belonging to subcategories to their parent categories. A small set of prominent categories is selected based on harmonic centrality measures in the subcategory graph; other nodes in the subcategory graph are aggregated to one of their nearest ancestors (see Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Article Selection and Label Generation ‣ 3 The Dataset ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\") for an example subgraph). See Boldi & Monti ( [2016])) for the details of the process. This avoids aggregation through many indirect steps, which would often lead to articles being mapped to categories which they have little semantic overlap with.\n\nHowever, the output still required further clean-up: some aggregated categories still contained unrelated articles. Additionally, if the subcategory graph related to some topic is very dense, the selected prominent categories and the aggregation choices can be very arbitrary.\n\nWiki-CS was created by inspecting the list of 10,0001000010,000 prominent categories selected by the sanitizer and picking a subject area with few such issues. We identified three possible candidate subjects (branches of biology, US states, branches of CS), and sampled 20 pages from every class of these candidates. Although all of these had some issues, we were able to clean up the CS data by dropping some categories and manually disabling aggregation across specific subcategories to prune bad pages from others. This resulted in a dataset with 10 classes corresponding to branches of computer science, with very high connectivity. See Appendix [B]Appendix B List of categories for each label ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\") for the set of prominent categories we used for each label. Finally, we dropped the articles that would have been mapped to multiple classes.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: A subgraph of the subcategory relation graph. Nodes with dark borders are the prominent categories chosen based on centrality. The others were aggregated to the nearest marked ancestor as denoted by their colors, with ties broken arbitrarily.\n\n### 3.2 Node Features\n\nSimilarly to previous work (Yang et al., [2016])), our node features were derived from the text of the corresponding articles. However, they were calculated as the average of pre-trained GloVe word embeddings (Pennington et al., [2014])) instead of using binary bag-of-words vectors. This allowed us to encode rich features corresponding to a large vocabulary in relatively small 300-dimensional input vectors, which can be an advantage for training large models on a GPU.\n\n### 3.3 Training Splits\n\nIt has been shown that the choice of the training split can seriously affect model performance for semi-supervised node classification (Shchur et al., [2018])). Therefore, using multiple training splits can improve the robustness of a benchmark (Klicpera et al., [2018])). For this reason, we randomly selected 20 different training splits from the data that was not used for testing.\n\nMore specifically, we split the nodes in each class into two sets, 50% for the test set and 50% potentially visible. From the visible set, we generated 20 different splits of training, validation and early-stopping sets: 5% of the nodes in each class were used for training in each split, 22.5% were used to evaluate the early-stopping criterion, and 22.5% were used as the validation set for hyperparameter tuning. We stored the resulting mask vectors with the rest of the dataset, so that they can be used consistently across all future work.\n\n### 3.4 Statistics and Structural Properties\n\nTable 1: Comparison of key dataset statistics between Wiki-CS and standard citation network benchmarks. SP stands for shortest path length.\n\n|  | Cora | CiteSeer | PubMed | Wiki-CS |\n| Classes | 7 | 6 | 3 | 10 |\n| Nodes | 2708 | 3327 | 19717 | 11701 |\n| Edges | 5429 | 4732 | 44338 | 216123 |\n| Features dim. | 1433 | 3703 | 500 | 300 |\n| Label rate | 3.6% | 5.2% | 0.3% | 5% |\n| Mean degree | 4.00 | 2.84 | 4.50 | 36.94 |\n| Average SP | 6.31 | 9.32 | 6.34 | 3.01 |\n\nTable [1]Table 1 ‣ 3.4 Statistics and Structural Properties ‣ 3 The Dataset ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\") summarises the key statistics of the citation network and the Wiki-CS datasets. Note the significantly higher rate of connectivity compared to existing benchmarks and the short average distance between any two nodes. This suggests that progress could be made on the benchmark by designing more involved computations within the neighborhood of a node, rather than focusing on long-range connections. This makes Wiki-CS a useful and complementary addition to existing node classification datasets.\n\nThis connectivity also leads to more varied node neighborhoods: for each node, we calculated the proportion of neighbors that belong to the same class as the node itself, and plotted this distribution for Wiki-CS as well as the existing citation network benchmarks. The results shown in Figure [2(d)]In Figure 2 ‣ 3.4 Statistics and Structural Properties ‣ 3 The Dataset ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\") show that the existing datasets have a large share of nodes in homogeneous neighborhoods, while Wiki-CS is significantly more varied.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)Cora\n\n![Refer to caption](b)CiteSeer\n\n![Refer to caption](c)PubMed\n\n![Refer to caption](d)Wiki-CS\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of the ratio of neighbors belonging to the same class. In all three the citation network datasets, almost two-thirds of all nodes have all neighbors belonging to the same class. The distribution of Wiki-CS is considerably more balanced.\n\nWe also visualized the structure of all four datasets using Deep Graph Mapper (Bodnar et al., [2020])), an unsupervised GNN-based visualisation technique. The results shown in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.4 Statistics and Structural Properties ‣ 3 The Dataset ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\") suggest that Wiki-CS might have a more centralized, hierarchical structure than the citation networks, which seems plausible considering the different source domains.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)Cora\n\n![Refer to caption](b)CiteSeer\n\n![Refer to caption](c)PubMed\n\n![Refer to caption](d)Wiki-CS\n\nFigure 3: Deep Graph Mapper (DGM) visualisation of benchmarks.

            "content": "### 4.1 Semi-Supervised Node Classification\n\nAs described in Section [3.3]Training Splits ‣ 3 The Dataset ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\"), 20 different training splits were created for the node classification task, each consisting of 5% of nodes from each class. The same test set (50% of the nodes) was evaluated for all splits. In each split, a different 22.5% of nodes is used for early-stopping: we finish training when the loss calculated on this set has not improved for 100 epochs, and evaluate the model snapshot that produced the lowest loss.\n\nThis evaluation was performed 5 times on each of the 20 splits; we report the mean accuracy with a 95% confidence interval based on bootstrap resampling from these results with 1,000 samples.\n\nThree GNN models were evaluated: GCN (Kipf & Welling, [2016a])), GAT (Veličković et al., [2017])) and APPNP (Klicpera et al., [2018])). Hyperparameter tuning was performed using the same training setup and measuring validation performance on 22.5% of the nodes disjoint from the training and early-stopping sets. For efficiency, only the first 10 (out of 20) splits were used for hyperparameter tuning. The model configurations are described in Appendix [A]Appendix A Hyperparameter settings ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\").\n\nTwo non-structural baselines were also included: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a support vector machine (SVM). These predicted the class for each node individually, based on the node features. Since SVMs are deterministic, we only had a single data point from each training split and report the mean accuracy.\n\nThe results are shown in Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 4.1 Semi-Supervised Node Classification ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\"). The relative model performances align well with the results on citation network benchmarks, providing evidence that these are indeed good general-purpose methods. It is perhaps surprising that the attention mechanism of GAT improved very little on the GCN result despite the large neighborhoods—one reason might be that it is difficult to learn what to attend to in the semi-supervised setting, as discussed in-depth by Knyazev et al. ( [2019])).\n\nThe model predictions were also visualised with Deep Graph Mapper, and are included in Appendix [C]Appendix C Deep Graph Mapper visualisation of model predictions ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\"). This was based on training each model once, on the first of the 20 training splits. As expected, the mistakes and disagreements are largely located near boundaries of classes. This reinforces the idea that more complex neighborhood aggregation methods might be able to improve prediction accuracy. There are also some less connected clusters that seem to produce consistent incorrect predictions under all models—this might be due to not having good training samples in their proximity.\n\nTable 2: Performance of semi-supervised node classification methods on the Wiki-CS dataset.

We split the data as follows: 85% of the real edges for training, 5% for validation and 10% for testing. For each group, the same number of negative examples (non-edge node pairs) was sampled uniformly at random.\n\nTwo GNN methods were benchmarked for link prediction: GraphStar (Haonan et al., [2019])) and VGAE (Kipf & Welling, [2016b])). They were trained using the configurations reported in the original works, except for the hidden layer size of GraphStar: a maximum size of 256 would fit on the GPU. Details are included in Appendix [A]Appendix A Hyperparameter settings ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\"). An MLP baseline was also trained using concatenated pairs of node feature vectors.\n\nThe results are shown in Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Link Prediction ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-Based Benchmark for Graph Neural Networks\"). Note the extremely high performance of all models, even the MLP baseline. It appears that randomly selected false edges are very easy to distinguish from true edges in this dataset, and harder negative samples would be needed for more meaningful benchmarking. The large number of edges aggravates this, but it is not the main cause: we performed an experiment where we trained the models on just 100001000010000 examples of each class, and found the metrics to be still comfortably above 0.90.90.9.

          "1 Introduction": {
            "content": "Modern classifiers, despite their widespread empirical success, are known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we are specifically concerned with so-called “data poisoning” attacks (formally, _causative_ attacks \\[Barreno et al. [2006]); Papernot et al. [2018])\\]), where the attacker manipulates some aspects of the training data in order to cause the learning algorithm to output a faulty classifier. Automated machine-learning systems which rely on large, user-generated datasets—e.g. email spam filters, product recommendation engines, and fake review detectors—are particularly susceptible to such attacks. For example, by maliciously flagging legitimate emails as spam and mislabeling spam as innocuous, an adversary can trick a spam filter into mistakenly letting through a particular email.\n\nData poisoning attacks in the literature include label-flipping attacks (Xiao et al., [2012])), where the labels of a training set can be adversarially manipulated to decrease performance of the trained classifier; general data poisoning, where both the training inputs and labels can be manipulated (Steinhardt et al., [2017])); and backdoor attacks (Chen et al., [2017]); Tran et al., [2018])), where the training set is corrupted so as to cause the classifier to deviate from its expected behavior only when triggered by a specific pattern. However, unlike the alternative test-time adversarial setting, where reasonably effective provable defenses exist, comparatively little work has been done on building classifiers that are certifiably robust to targeted data poisoning attacks.\n\nIn this work we propose a framework for building classifiers that are certifiably robust to a given class of data poisoning attacks, such as label-flipping or backdoor attacks. In particular, we propose what we refer to as a _pointwise_ certified defense—this means that with each prediction, the classifier includes a certificate guaranteeing that its prediction would not be different had it been trained on adversarially manipulated data up to some “radius of perturbation” (a formal definition is presented in Section [3]A General View of Randomized Smoothing ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")). We then demonstrate a specific instantiation of this protocol, constructing linear classifiers that are pointwise-certifiably robust to label-flipping attacks; i.e., each prediction is certified robust against a certain number of training label flips.\n\nPrior works on certified defenses make statistical guarantees over the entire test distribution, but they make no guarantees as to the robustness of a prediction on any particular test point; thus, a determined adversary could still cause a specific test point to be misclassified. We therefore consider the threat of a worst-case adversary that can make a training set perturbation to target _each test point individually_. This motivates a defense that can certify each of its individual predictions, as we present here. Compared to traditional robust classification, this framework is superior for a task such as determining who receives a coveted resource (a loan, parole, etc.), as it provides a guarantee for each individual, rather than at the population level. This work represents the first such pointwise certified defense to _any type of data poisoning attack_; we expect significant advances can be made on both attacks and defenses within this threat model.\n\nOur approach leverages randomized smoothing (Cohen et al., [2019])), a technique that has previously been used to guarantee test-time robustness to adversarial manipulation of the input to a deep network. However, where prior uses of randomized smoothing randomize over the input to the classifier for test-time guarantees, we instead randomize over _the entire training procedure of the classifier_. Specifically, by randomizing over the labels during this training process, we obtain an overall classification pipeline that is certified to not change its prediction when some number of labels are adversarially manipulated in the training set. Previous applications of randomized smoothing perform sampling to provide probabilistic bounds, due to the intractability of integrating the decision regions of a deep network. We instead derive an analytical bound, providing truly guaranteed robustness. Although a naive implementation of this approach would not be tractable, we show how to obtain these certified bounds with minimal additional runtime complexity over standard classification, suffering only a linear cost in the number of training points.\n\nA further distinction of our approach is that the applicability of our robustness guarantees do not rely upon stringent model assumptions or the quality of the features. Existing work on robust linear classification or regression provides certificates that only hold under specific model assumptions, e.g., recovering the best-fit linear coefficients, which is most useful when the data exhibit a linear relationship in the feature space. In contrast, our classifier makes no assumptions about the separability of the data or quality of the features; this means our certificates remain valid when applying our classifier to arbitrary features, which in practice allows us to leverage advances in unsupervised feature learning (Le, [2013]); Chen et al., [2020])) and transfer learning (Donahue et al., [2014])). We apply our classifier to pre-trained and unsupervised deep features to demonstrate its feasibility for classification of highly non-linear data such as ImageNet.\n\nWe evaluate our proposed classifier on several benchmark datasets common to the data poisoning literature. On the Dogfish binary classification challenge from ImageNet, our classifier maintains 81.3% certified accuracy in the face of an adversary who could reduce an undefended classifier to less than 1%. Additional experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate our algorithm’s effectiveness for multi-class classification. Moreover, our classifier maintains a reasonably competitive non-robust accuracy (e.g., 94.5% on MNIST 1/7 versus 99.1% for the undefended classifier).",

            "content": "#### Data poisoning attacks\n\nA _data poisoning attack_(Muñoz González et al., [2017]); Yang et al., [2017])) is an attack where an adversary corrupts some portion of the training set or adds new inputs, with the goal of degrading the performance of the learned model. The adversary is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the learning algorithm, so security by _design_—as opposed to obscurity—is the only viable defense against such attacks. The adversary is also typically assumed to have access to the training set and, in some cases, the test set.\n\nPrevious work has investigated attacks and defenses for data poisoning attacks applied to feature selection (Xiao et al., [2015])), SVMs (Biggio et al., [2011]); Xiao et al., [2012])), linear regression (Liu et al., [2017])), and PCA (Rubinstein et al., [2009])), to name a few. Some attacks can even achieve success with “clean-label” attacks, inserting adversarially perturbed, seemingly correctly labeled training examples that cause the classifier to perform poorly (Shafahi et al., [2018]); Zhu et al., [2019])). Interestingly, our defense can also be viewed as (the first) certified defense to such attacks: perturbing an image such that the resulting features no longer match the label is theoretically equivalent to changing the label such that it no longer matches the image’s features. For an overview of data poisoning attacks and defenses in machine learning, see Biggio et al. ( [2014])).\n\n#### Label-flipping attacks\n\nA _label-flipping attack_ is a specific type of data poisoning attack where the adversary is restricted to changing the training labels. The classifier is then trained on the corrupted training set, with no knowledge of which labels have been tampered with. For example, an adversary could mislabel spam emails as innocuous, or flag real product reviews as fake.\n\nUnlike random label noise, for which many robust learning algorithms have been successfully developed (Natarajan et al., [2013]); Liu & Tao, [2016]); Patrini et al., [2017])), adversarial label-flipping attacks can be specifically targeted to exploit the structure of the learning algorithm, significantly degrading performance. Robustness to such attacks is therefore harder to achieve, both theoretically and empirically (Xiao et al., [2012]); Biggio et al., [2011])). A common defense technique is _sanitization_, whereby a defender attempts to identify and remove or relabel training points that may have had their labels corrupted (Paudice et al., [2019]); Taheri et al., [2019])). Unfortunately, recent work has demonstrated that this is often not enough against a sufficiently powerful adversary (Koh et al., [2018])). Further, _no existing defenses_ provide pointwise guarantees regarding their robustness.\n\n#### Certified defenses\n\nExisting works on certified defenses to adversarial data poisoning attacks typically focus on the regression case and provide broad statistical guarantees over the entire test distribution. A common approach to such certifications is to show that a particular algorithm recovers some close approximation to the best linear fit coefficients (Diakonikolas et al., [2019]); Prasad et al., [2018]); Shen & Sanghavi, [2019])), or that the expected loss on the test distribution is bounded (Klivans et al., [2018]); Chen & Paschalidis, [2018])). These results generally rely on assumptions on the data distribution: some assume sparsity in the coefficients (Karmalkar & Price, [2018]); Chen et al., [2013])) or corruption vector (Bhatia et al., [2015])); others require limited effects of outliers (Steinhardt et al., [2017])). As mentioned above, all of these methods fail to provide guarantees for individual test points. Additionally, these statistical guarantees are not as meaningful when their model assumptions do not hold.\n\n#### Randomized smoothing\n\nSince the discovery of adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., [2013]); Goodfellow et al., [2015])), the research community has been investigating techniques for increasing the adversarial robustness of complex models such as deep networks. After a series of heuristic defenses, followed by attacks breaking them (Athalye et al., [2018]); Carlini & Wagner, [2017])), focus began to shift towards the development of _provable_ robustness.\n\nOne approach which has gained popularity in recent work is randomized smoothing. Rather than certifying the original classifier f𝑓f, randomized smoothing defines a new classifier g𝑔g whose prediction at an input x𝑥x is the class assigned the most probability when x𝑥x is perturbed with noise from some distribution μ𝜇\\\\mu and passed through f𝑓f. That is, g​(x)=arg⁡maxc⁡ℙϵ∼μ​(f​(x+ϵ)=c).𝑔𝑥subscript𝑐subscriptℙsimilar-toitalic-ϵ𝜇𝑓𝑥italic-ϵ𝑐g(x)=\\\\arg\\\\max\\_{c}\\\\;\\\\mathbb{P}\\_{\\\\epsilon\\\\sim\\\\mu}(f(x+\\\\epsilon)=c). This new classifier g𝑔g is then certified as robust, ideally without sacrificing too much accuracy compared to f𝑓f. The original formulation was presented by Lecuyer et al. ( [2018])) and borrowed ideas from differential privacy. The above definition is due to Li et al. ( [2018])) and was popularized by Cohen et al. ( [2019])), who derived a tight robustness guarantee.",

Where it is clear from context, we will omit the arguments, writing simply G𝐺G or g𝑔g. Intuitively, for two similar measures μ,ρ𝜇𝜌\\\\mu,\\\\rho, we would expect that for most ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi, even though G​(μ,ϕ)𝐺𝜇italic-ϕG(\\\\mu,\\\\phi) and G​(ρ,ϕ)𝐺𝜌italic-ϕG(\\\\rho,\\\\phi) may not be equal, the threshold function g𝑔g should satisfy g​(μ,ϕ)=g​(ρ,ϕ)𝑔𝜇italic-ϕ𝑔𝜌italic-ϕg(\\\\mu,\\\\phi)=g(\\\\rho,\\\\phi). Further, the degree to which μ𝜇\\\\mu and ρ𝜌\\\\rho can differ while still preserving this property should increase as G​(μ,ϕ)𝐺𝜇italic-ϕG(\\\\mu,\\\\phi) approaches either 0 or 1, because this increases the “margin” with which the function ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi is 0 or 1 respectively over the measure μ𝜇\\\\mu.

While this and all previous works only consider probability measures, the framework we present here could easily be extended to allow for more general measures μ,ρ𝜇𝜌\\\\mu,\\\\rho and functions ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi.

We will sometimes use p𝑝p in place of G​(μ,ϕ)𝐺𝜇italic-ϕG(\\\\mu,\\\\phi), representing the fraction of the vote that the majority class receives (analogous to pAsubscript𝑝𝐴p\\_{A} in Cohen et al.

Lee et al. ( [2019])) consider an alternative approach for dealing with discrete variables.\n\n###### Example 2.\n\nThe randomized smoothing guarantee of Lee et al.

This is done by drawing samples from μ𝜇\\\\mu and using these to construct a high-probability bound on G𝐺G for certification. More precisely, this bound should be a _lower_ bound on G𝐺G when the hard prediction g=1𝑔1g=1 and an _upper_ bound otherwise; this ensures in both cases that we under-certify the true robustness of the classifier g𝑔g. The procedure is shown in Algorithm [2]Algorithm 2 ‣ Appendix A Generic Randomized Smoothing Algorithm ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") in Appendix [A]Appendix A Generic Randomized Smoothing Algorithm ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\").

            "content": "We now present the main contributions of this paper: we first describe a generic strategy for applying randomized smoothing to certify a prediction function against arbitrary classes of data poisoning attacks. We then propose a specific implementation of said strategy to certify a classifier against label-flipping attacks. We show how this approach can be made tractable using linear least-squares classification, and we use the Chernoff inequality to analytically bound the relevant probabilities for the randomized smoothing certificate. Notably, although we are employing a randomized approach, the final algorithm does not use any random sampling, but rather relies upon a convex optimization problem to compute the certified robustness.\n\n#### General data poisoning robustness\n\nWe begin by noting that in prior work, randomized smoothing was applied at test time with the function ϕ:𝒳→{0,1}:italic-ϕ→𝒳01\\\\phi:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\{0,1\\\\} being a (potentially deep) classifier that we wish to smooth. However, there is no requirement that the function ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi be a classifier at all; the theory holds for any binary-valued function. Instead of treating ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi as a trained classifier, we consider ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi to be _an arbitrary learning algorithm_ which takes as input a training dataset {xi,yi}i=1n∈(𝒳×{0,1})nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑛superscript𝒳01𝑛\\\\{x\\_{i},y\\_{i}\\\\}\\_{i=1}^{n}\\\\in(\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\{0,1\\\\})^{n} and additional test points without corresponding labels, which we aim to predict.333Note that our algorithm does not require access to the test data to do the necessary precomputation. We present it here as such merely to give an intuitive idea of the procedure. In other words, the combined goal of ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi is to first train a classifier and then predict the label of the new example. Thus, we consider test time outputs to be a function of both the test time input and the training data that produced the classifier. This perspective allows us to reason about how changes to training data affect the classifier at test time, reminiscent of work on influence functions of deep neural networks (Koh & Liang, [2017]); Yeh et al., [2018])).\n\nThis immediately suggests our protocol for pointwise robustness to general data poisoning attacks: randomize over the elements of the input to which we desire certified robustness, rather than over the test-time input to be classified. For example, to induce robustness to backdoor attacks, we could randomly add noise to the training points and/or their labels. Analogous to previous applications of randomized smoothing, if the majority vote of the classifiers trained with these randomly perturbed inputs has a large margin, it will confer a degree of robustness within an appropriately-defined radius of adversarially perturbed training data (as defined in Equation [1]In Definition 1. ‣ 3 A General View of Randomized Smoothing ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")).\n\n#### Specific application to label-flipping robustness\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, we now present a specific implementation, providing an algorithm for tractable linear classification which is pointwise-certifiably robust to label-flipping attacks. When applying randomized smoothing in this setting, we randomize over the labels in the training set as described above—a suitably large margin in the majority vote will therefore result in pointwise robustness to adversarial label flips. In this scenario, the adversarial “radius” is defined as number of labels on which two training sets differ.\n\nTo formalize this intuition, consider two different assignments of n𝑛n training labels Y1,Y2∈{0,1}nsubscript𝑌1subscript𝑌2superscript01𝑛Y\\_{1},Y\\_{2}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n} which differ on precisely r𝑟r labels. Let μ𝜇\\\\mu (resp. ρ𝜌\\\\rho) be the distribution resulting from independently flipping each of the labels in Y1subscript𝑌1Y\\_{1} (resp. Y2subscript𝑌2Y\\_{2}) with probability q𝑞q. It is clear that as r𝑟r increases, KL​(μ∥ρ)KLconditional𝜇𝜌\\\\mathrm{KL}(\\\\mu\\\\;\\\\\\|\\\\;\\\\rho) will also increase. In fact, it is simple to show (see Appendix [B.3]B.3 KL Divergence Bound ‣ Appendix B The Multi-Class Setting ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") for derivation) that the exact KL divergence between these two distributions is\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | KL​(μ∥ρ)=KL​(ρ∥μ)=r​(1−2​q)​log⁡(1−qq).KLconditional𝜇𝜌KLconditional𝜌𝜇𝑟12𝑞1𝑞𝑞\\\\mathrm{KL}(\\\\mu\\\\;\\\\\\|\\\\;\\\\rho)=\\\\mathrm{KL}(\\\\rho\\\\;\\\\\\|\\\\;\\\\mu)=r(1-2q)\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{1-q}{q}\\\\right). |  | (4) |\n\nPlugging in the robustness guarantee ( [3]In Example 3 (Generic bound). ‣ Instantiations of randomized smoothing ‣ 3 A General View of Randomized Smoothing ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")), we have that g​(μ,ϕ)=g​(ρ,ϕ)𝑔𝜇italic-ϕ𝑔𝜌italic-ϕg(\\\\mu,\\\\phi)=g(\\\\rho,\\\\phi) so long as\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | r≤log⁡(4​p​(1−p))2​(1−2​q)​log⁡(q1−q),𝑟4𝑝1𝑝212𝑞𝑞1𝑞r\\\\leq\\\\frac{\\\\log(4p(1-p))}{2(1-2q)\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{q}{1-q}\\\\right)}, |  | (5) |\n\nwhere p=G​(μ,ϕ)𝑝𝐺𝜇italic-ϕp=G(\\\\mu,\\\\phi).\nThis implies that for any test point, as long as ( [5]In Specific application to label-flipping robustness ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) is satisfied, g𝑔g’s prediction (the majority vote weighted by the smoothing distribution) will not change if an adversary corrupts the training set from Y1subscript𝑌1Y\\_{1} to Y2subscript𝑌2Y\\_{2}, or indeed to any other training set that differs on at most r𝑟r labels. We can tune the noise hyperparameter q𝑞q to achieve the largest possible upper bound in ( [5]In Specific application to label-flipping robustness ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")); more noise will likely decrease the margin of the majority vote p𝑝p, but it will also decrease the divergence.\n\n#### Computing a tight bound\n\nThis approach has a simple closed form, but the bound is not tight. We can derive a tight bound via a combinatorial approach as in Lee et al. ( [2019])). By precomputing the quantities ℱ1−q,1,n−1​(r)subscriptsuperscriptℱ11𝑞1𝑛𝑟\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\_{1-q,1,n}(r) from Equation ( [2]In Example 2. ‣ Instantiations of randomized smoothing ‣ 3 A General View of Randomized Smoothing ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) for each r𝑟r, we can simply compare p𝑝p to each of these and thereby certify robustness to the highest possible number of label flips. This precomputation can be expensive, but it provides a significantly tighter robustness guarantee, certifying approximately twice as many label flips for a given bound on G𝐺G (See Figure [E.3]Figure E.3 ‣ Appendix E Additional Plots ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") in the Appendix).\n\n### 4.1 Efficient implementation via least squares classifiers\n\nThere may appear to be one major impracticality of the algorithm proposed in the previous section, if considered naively: treating the function ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi as an entire training-plus-single-prediction process would require that we train multiple classifiers, over multiple random draws of the labels y𝑦y, all to make a prediction on a single example. In this section, we describe a sequence of tools we employ to restrict the architecture and training process in a manner that drastically reduces this cost, bringing it in line with the traditional cost of standard classification.

Given the training set {xi,yi}i=1nsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑛\\\\{x\\_{i},y\\_{i}\\\\}\\_{i=1}^{n}, we assume that there exists some feature mapping h:ℝd→ℝk:ℎ→superscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑘h:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{k} (where k<n𝑘𝑛k<n). If existing linear features are not available, this could instead consist of deep features learned from a similar task—the transferability of such features is well documented (Donahue et al., [2014]); Bo et al., [2010]); Yosinski et al., [2014]))—or features could be learned in an unsupervised fashion on x1:nsubscript𝑥:1𝑛x\\_{1:n} (learning the features from poisoned labels could degrade performance). Given this feature mapping, let 𝐗=h​(x1:n)∈ℝn×k𝐗ℎsubscript𝑥:1𝑛superscriptℝ𝑛𝑘\\\\mathbf{X}=h(x\\_{1:n})\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times k} be the training point features and let 𝐲=y1:n∈{0,1}n𝐲subscript𝑦:1𝑛superscript01𝑛\\\\mathbf{y}=y\\_{1:n}\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^{n} be the labels. Our training process consists of finding the least-squares fit to the training data, i.e., we find parameters 𝜷^∈ℝk^𝜷superscriptℝ𝑘\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{k} via the normal equation 𝜷^=(𝐗T​𝐗)−1​𝐗T​𝐲^𝜷superscriptsuperscript𝐗𝑇𝐗1superscript𝐗𝑇𝐲\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}=\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{y} and then we make a prediction on the new example via the linear function h​(xn+1)​𝜷^ℎsubscript𝑥𝑛1^𝜷h(x\\_{n+1})\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}. Although it may seem odd to fit a classification task with least-squares loss, binary classification with linear regression is equivalent to Fisher’s linear discriminant (Mika, [2003])) and works quite well in practice.\n\nThe real advantage of the least-squares approach is that it reduces the prediction to a linear function of 𝐲𝐲\\\\mathbf{y}, and thus randomizing over the labels is straightforward. Specifically, letting\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜶=𝐗​(𝐗T​𝐗)−1​h​(xn+1)T,𝜶𝐗superscriptsuperscript𝐗𝑇𝐗1ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑛1𝑇\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}=\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right)^{-1}h(x\\_{n+1})^{T}, |  |\n\nthe prediction h​(xn+1)​𝜷^ℎsubscript𝑥𝑛1^𝜷h(x\\_{n+1})\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} can be equivalently given by 𝜶T​𝐲superscript𝜶𝑇𝐲\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^{T}\\\\mathbf{y} (this is effectively the kernel representation of the linear classifier). Thus, we can simply compute 𝜶𝜶\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} one time and then randomly sample many different sets of labels in order to build a standard randomized smoothing bound. Further, we can pre-compute just the 𝐗​(𝐗T​𝐗)−1𝐗superscriptsuperscript𝐗𝑇𝐗1\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\right)^{-1} term and reuse it for each test point.\n\n#### ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\\\ell\\_{2} regularization for better conditioning\n\nIt is unlikely to be the case that the training points are well-behaved for linear classification in the feature space. To address this, we instead solve an ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\\\ell\\_{2} regularized version of least-squares. This is a common tool for solving systems with ill-conditioned or random design matrices (Hsu et al., [2014]); Suggala et al., [2018])). Luckily, there still exists a pre-computable closed-form solution to this problem, whereby we instead solve\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜶=𝐗​(𝐗T​𝐗+λ​𝐈)−1​h​(xn+1)T.𝜶𝐗superscriptsuperscript𝐗𝑇𝐗𝜆𝐈1ℎsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑛1𝑇\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}=\\\\mathbf{X}(\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}+\\\\lambda\\\\mathbf{I})^{-1}h(x\\_{n+1})^{T}. |  |\n\nThe other parts of our algorithm remain unchanged. Following results in Suggala et al. ( [2018])), we set the regularization parameter λ=(1+q)​σ^2​k2​n​κ​(𝐗T​𝐗)𝜆1𝑞superscript^𝜎2𝑘2𝑛𝜅superscript𝐗𝑇𝐗\\\\lambda=(1+q)\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^{2}k}{2n}\\\\kappa(\\\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\\\mathbf{X}) for all our experiments, where σ^2=‖𝐲−𝐗​𝜷^O​L​S‖22n−ksuperscript^𝜎2superscriptsubscriptnorm𝐲𝐗subscript^𝜷𝑂𝐿𝑆22𝑛𝑘\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^{2}=\\\\frac{\\\\\\|\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}\\_{OLS}\\\\\\|\\_{2}^{2}}{n-k} is an estimate of the variance (Dicker, [2014])) and κ​(⋅)𝜅⋅\\\\kappa(\\\\cdot) is the condition number.\n\n#### Efficient tail bounds via the Chernoff inequality\n\nEven more compelling, due to the linear structure of this prediction, we can forego a sampling-based approach entirely and directly bound the tail probabilities using Chernoff bounds. Because the underlying binary prediction function ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi will output the label 111 for the test point whenever 𝜶T​𝐲≥1/2superscript𝜶𝑇𝐲12\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^{T}\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\geq 1/2 and 00 otherwise, we can derive an analytical upper bound on the probability that g𝑔g predicts one label or the other via the Chernoff bound. By upper bounding the probability of the _opposite_ prediction, we simultaneously derive a lower bound on p𝑝p which can be plugged in to ( [5]In Specific application to label-flipping robustness ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) to determine the classifier’s robustness. Concretely, we can upper bound the probability that the classifier outputs the label 0 by\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | P​(𝜶T​𝐲≤1/2)≤mint>0⁡{et/2​∏i=1nE​\\[e−t​𝜶i​yi\\]}=mint>0⁡{et/2​∏i=1nq​e−t​𝜶i​(1−yi)+(1−q)​e−t​𝜶i​yi}.𝑃superscript𝜶𝑇𝐲12subscript𝑡0superscript𝑒𝑡2superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑛𝐸delimited-\\[\\]superscript𝑒𝑡subscript𝜶𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝑡0superscript𝑒𝑡2superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑖1𝑛𝑞superscript𝑒𝑡subscript𝜶𝑖1subscript𝑦𝑖1𝑞superscript𝑒𝑡subscript𝜶𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖P(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^{T}\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\leq 1/2)\\\\leq\\\\min\\_{t>0}\\\\left\\\\{e^{t/2}\\\\prod\\_{i=1}^{n}E\\[e^{-t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\_{i}y\\_{i}}\\]\\\\right\\\\}\\\\\\<br>=\\\\min\\_{t>0}\\\\left\\\\{e^{t/2}\\\\prod\\_{i=1}^{n}qe^{-t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\_{i}(1-y\\_{i})}+(1-q)e^{-t\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}\\_{i}y\\_{i}}\\\\right\\\\}. |  | (6) |\n\nConversely, the probability that the classifier outputs the label 1 is upper bounded by ( [6]In Efficient tail bounds via the Chernoff inequality ‣ 4.1 Efficient implementation via least squares classifiers ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) but evaluated at −t𝑡-t. Thus, we can solve the minimization problem unconstrained over t𝑡t, and then let the sign of t𝑡t dictate which label to predict and the value of t𝑡t determine the bound. The objective ( [6]In Efficient tail bounds via the Chernoff inequality ‣ 4.1 Efficient implementation via least squares classifiers ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) is log-convex in t𝑡t and can be easily solved by Newton’s method. Note that in some cases, neither Chernoff upper bound will be less than 1/2121/2, meaning we cannot determine the true value of g𝑔g. In these cases, we simply define the classifier’s prediction to be determined by the sign of t𝑡t. While we can’t guarantee that this classification will match the true majority vote, our algorithm will certify\na robustness to 0 flips, so the guarantee is still valid. We avoid abstaining so as to assess our classifier’s non-robust accuracy.\n\nThe key property we emphasize is that, unlike previous randomized smoothing applications, the final algorithm involves _no randomness whatsoever_. Instead, the probabilities are bounded directly via the Chernoff bound, without any need for Monte Carlo approximation. Thus, the method is able to generate _truly certifiable_ robust predictions using approximately the same complexity as traditional predictions.",

          "5 Experiments": {
            "content": "Following Koh & Liang ( [2017])) and Steinhardt et al. ( [2017])), we perform experiments on MNIST 1/7, the IMDB review sentiment dataset (Maas et al., [2011])), and the Dogfish binary classification challenge taken from ImageNet. We run additional experiments on multi-class MNIST and CIFAR10. For each dataset and each noise level q𝑞q we report the _certified test set accuracy_ at r𝑟r training label flips. That is, for each possible number of flips r𝑟r, we plot the fraction of the test set that was both correctly classified and certified to not change under at least r𝑟r flips.\n\nAs mentioned, our classifier suffers an additional linear cost in the number of training points due to the kernel representation 𝜶T​𝐲superscript𝜶𝑇𝐲\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}^{T}\\\\mathbf{y}. For most datasets there was no discernible difference in the time required to certify an input via our technique versus neural network classiﬁcation. For larger training sets such as CIFAR10, especially when doing pairwise comparisons for the multi-class case, the algorithm is embarassingly parallel; this parallelism brings runtime back in line with standard classification.\n\n![Refer to caption](a)Binary MNIST (classes 1 and 7)\n\n![Refer to caption](b)Full MNIST\n\nFigure 1: MNIST 1/7 (n=13007𝑛13007n=13007, top) and full MNIST (n=60000𝑛60000n=60000, bottom) test set certified accuracy to adversarial label flips as q𝑞q is varied. The bottom axis represents the number of adversarial label flips to which _each individual prediction_ is robust, while the top axis is the same value expressed as a percentage of the training set size. The solid lines represent certified accuracy; dashed lines of the same color are the overall non-robust accuracy of each classifier. The black dotted line is the (infinitely robust) performance of a constant classifier, while the black dash-dot line is the (uncertified) performance of our classifier with no label noise.\n\nFor binary classification, one could technically achieve a certified accuracy of 50% at r=∞𝑟r=\\\\infty (or 10% for MNIST or CIFAR10) by letting g𝑔g be constant—a constant classifier would be infinitely robust. Though not a very meaningful baseline, we include the accuracy of such a classifier in our plots (black dotted line) as a reference. We also evaluated our classifier with q=0𝑞0q=0 (black dash-dot line); this cannot certify robustness, but it indicates the quality of the features.\n\nTo properly justify the need for such certified defenses, and to get a sense of the scale of our certifications, we generated label-flipping attacks against the undefended binary MNIST and Dogfish models. Following previous work, the undefended models were implemented as convolutional neural networks, trained on the clean data, with all but the top layer frozen—this is equivalent to multinomial logistic regression on the learned features. For each test point we recorded how many flips were required to change the network’s prediction. This number serves as an upper bound for the robustness of the network on that test point, but we note that our attacks were quite rudimentary and could almost certainly be improved upon to tighten this upper bound. Appendix [C.1]C.1 Attacks on Undefended Classifiers ‣ Appendix C Description of Label-Flipping Attacks ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") contains the details of our attack implementations. Finally, we implemented attacks on our own defense to derive an empirical upper bound and found that it reasonably tracks our lower bound. Plots and details of this attack can be found in Appendix [C.2]C.2 Attacks on Our Classifier ‣ Appendix C Description of Label-Flipping Attacks ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\").\n\nIn all plots, the solid lines represent certified accuracy (except for the undefended classifier, which is an upper bound), while the dashed lines of the same color are the overall non-robust accuracy of each classifier.\n\n#### Results on MNIST\n\nThe MNIST 1/7 dataset (LeCun et al., [1998])) consists of just the classes 1 and 7, totalling 13,007 training points and 2,163 test points. We trained a simple convolutional neural network on the other eight MNIST digits to learn a 50-dimensional feature embedding and then calculated Chernoff bounds for G𝐺G as described in Section [4.1]Efficient implementation via least squares classifiers ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\"). Figure [1(a)]In Figure 1 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") displays the certified accuracy on the test set for varying probabilities q𝑞q. As in prior work on randomized smoothing, the noise parameter q𝑞q balances a trade-off; as q𝑞q increases, the required margin \\|G−12\\|𝐺12\\|G-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\| to certify a given number of flips decreases. On the other hand, this results in more noisy training labels, which reduces the margin and therefore results in lower robustness and often lower accuracy. Figure [1(b)]In Figure 1 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") depicts the certified accuracy for the full MNIST test set—see Appendix [B]Appendix B The Multi-Class Setting ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") for derivations of the bounds and optimization algorithm in the multi-class case. In addition to this being a significantly more difficult classification task, our classifier could not rely on features learned from other handwritten digits; instead, we extracted the top 30 components with ICA (Hyvarinen, [1999])) independently of the labels. Despite the lack of fine-tuned features, our algorithm still achieves significant certified accuracy under a large number of adversarial label flips.\n\nSee Figure [E.1]Figure E.1 ‣ Appendix E Additional Plots ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") in the Appendix for the effect of ℓ2subscriptℓ2\\\\ell\\_{2} regularization for the binary case. At a moderate cost to non-robust accuracy, the regularization results in substantially higher certified accuracy at almost all radii. We observed that regularization did not make a large difference for the multi-class case, possibly due to the inaccuracy of the residual term in the noise estimate.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: CIFAR10 (n=50000𝑛50000n=50000) test set certified accuracy to adversarial label flips as q𝑞q is varied.\n\n#### Results on CIFAR10\n\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of our classifier with unsupervised features, we used SimCLR (Chen et al., [2020])) to learn unsupervised features for CIFAR10. We used PCA to reduce the features to 128 dimensions to reduce overfitting. Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ Results on MNIST ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") shows the results: our classifier with q=0.12𝑞0.12q=0.12 achieves 50% certified accuracy up to 175 labels flips (recall there are ten classes, not two) and decays gracefully. Further, the classifier maintains better than random chance certified accuracy up to 427 label flips, which is approximately 1% of the training set.\n\nBecause the “votes” are changed by flipping so few labels, high values of q𝑞q reduce the models’ predictions to almost pure chance—this means we are unable to achieve the margins necessary to certify a large number of flips. We therefore found that smaller levels of noise achieved higher certified test accuracy. This suggests that the more susceptible the original, non-robust classifier is to label flips, the lower q𝑞q should be set for the corresponding randomized classifier.\n\nFor much smaller values of q𝑞q, slight differences did not decrease the non-robust accuracy—they did however have a large effect on certified robustness. This indicates that the sign of t⋆superscript𝑡⋆t^{\\\\star} is relatively stable, but the margin of G𝐺G is much less so. This same pattern was observed with the IMDB and Dogfish datasets. We used a high-precision arithmetic library (Johansson et al., [2013])) to achieve the necessary lower bounds, but the precision required for non-vacuous bounds grew extremely fast for q<10−4𝑞superscript104q<10^{-4}; optimizing ( [6]In Efficient tail bounds via the Chernoff inequality ‣ 4.1 Efficient implementation via least squares classifiers ‣ 4 Pointwise Data Poisoning Robustness ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\")) quickly became too computationally expensive.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Dogfish (n=1800𝑛1800n=1800) test set certified accuracy to adversarial label flips as q𝑞q is varied.\n\n#### Results on Dogfish\n\nThe Dogfish dataset contains images from the ImageNet dog and fish synsets, 900 training points and 300 test points from each. We trained a ResNet-50 (He et al., [2016])) on the standard ImageNet training set but removed all images labeled dog or fish. Our pre-trained network therefore learned meaningful image features but had no features specific to either class. We again used PCA to reduce the feature space dimensionality. Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ Results on CIFAR10 ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") displays the results of our poisoning attack along with our certified defense. Under the undefended model, more than 99% of the test points can be successfully attacked with no more than 23 label flips, whereas our model with q=10−4𝑞superscript104q=10^{-4} can certifiably correctly classify 81.3% of the test points under the same threat model. It would take more than four times as many flips—more than 5% of the training set—for _each test point individually_ to reduce our classifier to less than 50% certified accuracy.\n\nHere we observe the same pattern, where reducing q𝑞q does not have a large effect on non-robust accuracy but does increase robustness significantly. This provides further evidence for the hypothesis that more complex datasets/classifiers are more susceptible to attacks and should be smoothed with less label noise.\n\nFigure [E.2]Figure E.2 ‣ Appendix E Additional Plots ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") in the Appendix shows our classifier’s performance with unsupervised features. Because Dogfish is such a small dataset (n=1800𝑛1800n=1800), deep unsupervised feature learning techniques were not feasible—we instead learned overcomplete features on 16x16 image patches using RICA (Le, [2013])).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: IMDB Review Sentiment (n=25000𝑛25000n=25000) test set certified accuracy. The non-robust accuracy slightly decreases as q𝑞q increases; for q=0.01𝑞0.01q=0.01 the non-robust accuracy is 79.11%, while for q=0.1𝑞0.1q=0.1 it is 78.96%.\n\n#### Results on IMDB\n\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‣ Results on Dogfish ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Certified Robustness to Label-Flipping Attacks via Randomized Smoothing\") plots the result of our randomized smoothing procedure on the IMDB review sentiment dataset. This dataset contains 25,000 training examples and 25,000 test examples, evenly split between “positive” and “negative”. To extract the features we applied the Google News pre-trained Word2Vec to all the words in each review and averaged them. This feature embedding is considerably noisier than that of an image dataset, as most of the words in a review are irrelevant to sentiment classification. Indeed, Steinhardt et al. ( [2017])) also found that the IMDB dataset was much more susceptible to adversarial corruption than images when using bag-of-words features. Consistent with this, we found smaller levels of noise resulted in larger certified accuracy. We expect significant improvements could be made with a more refined choice of feature embedding.",

            "content": "In this work we presented a unifying view of randomized smoothing, which borrows from the literature of differential privacy in order to provide black-box certificates of robustness. Based on the observation that this framework is applicable more broadly than just defenses to adversarial examples, we used it to derive a framework for certified defenses against arbitrary data poisoning attacks—we dub such defenses “pointwise” because they provide a certificate of robustness for each test point.\n\nWe next implemented this protocol as a specific classifier which is robust to a strong class of label-flipping attacks, where an adversary can flip labels to target each test point individually. This contrasts with previous data poisoning defenses which have typically only considered an adversary who wishes to degrade the classifier’s accuracy on the test distribution as a whole. Finally, we offered a tractable algorithm for evaluating this classifier which, despite being rooted in randomization, can be computed with no Monte Carlo sampling whatsoever, resulting in a truly certifiably robust classifier. This work represents the first classification algorithm that is pointwise-certifiably robust to _any type_ of data poisoning attack; we anticipate many possible new directions within this framework.\n\nA particular strength of this framework is when we specifically care about robustly classifying each input individually. Compared to traditional robust classification, this technique is superior for determining who receives a coveted resource (a loan, parole, etc.) or for making some other sensitive classification, as it provides a guarantee for each individual. Other works only ensure that they correctly classify some fraction p𝑝p of the population, which is often not acceptable as that still leaves the 1−p1𝑝1-p fraction who could be misclassified, with no indication of which ones belong to the test set.\n\nThere are several avenues for improvements to this line of work. Most immediately, our protocol could be implemented with other types of smoothing distributions applied to the training data, such as randomizing over the input data or features, to derive specific algorithms that are pointwise-certifiably robust to other types of data poisoning attacks. Additionally, the method for learning the input features in an unsupervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised manner could be improved. Finally, we hope that our defense to this threat model will inspire the development of more powerful (e.g., pointwise) train-time attacks, against which future defenses can be evaluated.",
