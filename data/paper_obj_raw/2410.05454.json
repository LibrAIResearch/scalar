Schimel et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib29 \"\"); Dowling et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib6 \"\")).\nWhile latent dynamics provide valuable insights into behavior and generate testable hypotheses of neural computation (Luo et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib20 \"\"); Nair et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib23 \"\")), they are typically inferred from a single recording session.\nAs a result, these models are sensitive to small variations in the underlying dynamics and exhibit limited generalization capabilities.\nIn parallel, a large body of work in machine learning has focused on training models from diverse datasets that can rapidly adapt to novel settings.\nHowever, there has been limited work on inferring generalizable dynamical systems from data, with existing approaches mainly applied to settings with known low-dimensional dynamics (Yin et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib35 \"\"); Kirchmeyer et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib16 \"\")).\n\nIntegrating noisy neural recordings from different animals and/or tasks for learning the underlying dynamics presents a unique set of challenges.\nThis is partly due to heterogeneities in recordings across sessions such as the number and tuning properties of recorded neurons, as well as different stimulus statistics and behavioral modalities across cognitive tasks.\nThis challenge is further compounded by the lack of inductive biases for disentangling the variabilities across dynamics into shared and dataset-specific components.\nRecent evidence suggests that learned latent dynamics underlying activity of task-trained biological and artificial neural networks demonstrate similarities when engaged in related tasks (Gallego et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib11 \"\"); Maheswaranathan et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib21 \"\"); Safaie et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib28 \"\")).\nIn a related line of work, neural networks trained to perform multiple cognitive tasks with overlapping cognitive components learn to reuse dynamical motifs, thereby facilitating few-shot adaptation on novel tasks (Turner & Barak, [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib31 \"\"); Driscoll et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib8 \"\")).\n\nMotivated by these observations, we propose a novel framework for meta-learning latent dynamics from neural recordings.\nOur approach is to encode the variations in the latent dynamical structure present across neural recordings in a low-dimensional vector,\ne∈ℝde𝑒superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒e\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}},\nwhich we refer to as the dynamical embedding.\nDuring training, the model learns to adapt a common latent dynamical system model conditioned on the dynamical embedding.\nWe learn the dynamical embedding manifold from a diverse collection of neural recordings, allowing rapid learning of latent dynamics in the analysis of data-limited regime commonly encountered in neuroscience experiments.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nWe propose a novel parameterization of latent dynamics that facilitates integration and learning of meta-structure over diverse neural recordings.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nWe develop an inference scheme to jointly infer the embedding and latent state trajectory, as well as the corresponding dynamics model directly from data.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our method on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting for synthetic datasets and motor cortex recordings obtained during different reaching tasks.\n\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454/assets/x1.png)Figure 1: A. Neural recordings display heterogeneities in the number and tuning properties of recorded neurons and reflect diverse behavioral responses. The low-dimensional embedding manifold captures this diversity in dynamics.\nB. Our method learns to adapt a common latent dynamics conditioned on the embedding via low-rank changes to the model parameters.\n\n## 2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454/assets/x2.png)Figure 2: A. Three different example neural recordings, where the speed of the latent dynamics varies across them.\nB. One generative model is trained on M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets.\nWhile increasing the number of datasets allows the model to learn limit cycle, it is unable to capture the different speeds leading to poor forecasting performance.\n\nNeurons from different sessions and/or subjects are partially observed, non-overlapping and exhibit diverse response properties.\nEven chronic recordings from a single subject exhibit drift in neural tuning over time (Driscoll et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib7 \"\")).\nMoreover, non-simultaneously recorded neural activity lack pairwise correspondence between single trials.\nThis makes joint inference of latent states and learning the corresponding latent dynamics by integrating different recordings ill-posed and highly non-trivial.\n\nAs an illustrative example, let’s consider a case where these recordings exhibit oscillatory latent dynamics with variable velocities (Fig. [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2.F2 \"Figure 2 ‣ 2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nOne possible strategy for jointly inferring the dynamics from these recordings is learning a shared dynamics model, along with dataset-specific likelihood functions that map these dynamics to individual recordings.\nHowever, without additional inductive biases, this strategy does not generally perform well when there are variabilities in the underlying dynamics.\nSpecifically, when learning dynamics from two example datasets (M=2)𝑀2(M=2), we observed that a model with shared dynamics either learned separate solutions or overfit to one dataset, obscuring global structure across recordings (Fig. [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2.F2 \"Figure 2 ‣ 2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nWhen we increased the diversity of training data (M=20)𝑀20(M=20), the dynamics exhibited a more coherent global structure, albeit with an overlapping solution space (Fig. [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2.F2 \"Figure 2 ‣ 2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B).\nAs a result, this model had poor forecasting performance of neural activity in both cases, which is evident in the k-step r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} (Fig. [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2.F2 \"Figure 2 ‣ 2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B). While we have a-priori knowledge of the source of variations in dynamics for this example, this is typically not the case with real neural recordings.\nTherefore, we develop an approach for inferring the variation across recordings and use it to define a solution space of related dynamical systems (Fig. [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S1.F1 \"Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\n\n## 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics\n\nLet y1:T1:Msuperscriptsubscript𝑦:1𝑇:1𝑀y\\_{1:T}^{1:M} denote neural time series datasets of length T𝑇T, with yti∈ℝdyisuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑖superscriptℝsuperscriptsubscript𝑑𝑦𝑖y\\_{t}^{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{y}^{i}}, collected from M𝑀M different sessions and/or subjects during related tasks.\nWe are interested in learning a generative model that can jointly describe the evolution of the latent states across these datasets and rapidly adapt to novel datasets from limited trajectories.\nIn this work, we focus on state-space models (SSM), a powerful class of generative models for spatio-temporal datasets.\nAn SSM is described via the following pair of equations (we drop the superscript for ease of presentation),\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | zt∣zt−1conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1\\\\displaystyle z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t-1} | ∼pθ​(zt∣zt−1),similar-toabsentsubscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t-1}), |  | (1) |\n|  | yt∣ztconditionalsubscript𝑦𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡\\\\displaystyle y\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t} | ∼pϕ​(yt∣zt),similar-toabsentsubscript𝑝italic-ϕconditionalsubscript𝑦𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\phi}(y\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t}), |  | (2) |\n\nwhere zt∈ℝdzsubscript𝑧𝑡superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑧z\\_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{z}} is the latent state at time t𝑡t, pθ​(zt∣zt−1)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t-1}) is the dynamics model\nand pϕ​(yt∣zt)subscript𝑝italic-ϕconditionalsubscript𝑦𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡p\\_{\\\\phi}(y\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t}) is the likelihood function that maps the latent state to observed data.\n\nFollowing standard practice, we parameterize the dynamics as pθ​(zt∣zt−1)=𝒩​(zt∣fθ​(zt−1),Q)subscript𝑝𝜃conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑧𝑡1𝒩conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡subscript𝑓𝜃subscript𝑧𝑡1𝑄p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z\\_{t-1})=\\\\mathcal{N}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}f\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\_{t-1}),Q), where fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} is a deep neural network (DNN) and Q𝑄Q is a covariance matrix111We note that Q𝑄Q can also be parameterized via a neural network as well..\nAs previous work has shown that making both the likelihood and dynamics highly expressive can lead to optimization issues (Bowman et al., [2015](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib2 \"\")), we model the likelihood as a linear function of ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z\\_{t}.\nFor instance;

This decomposition of latent dynamics explicitly introduces an inductive bias that encourages θ𝜃\\\\theta and εisuperscript𝜀𝑖\\\\varepsilon^{i} to capture the shared and dataset-specific dynamical structure respectively.\nWhile this formulation is appealing, the equal dimensionality of εisuperscript𝜀𝑖\\\\varepsilon^{i} and θ𝜃\\\\theta could lead the model to overly rely on dataset-specific terms. Additionally, using DNNs for modeling latent dynamics introduces a large number of parameters, thereby limiting the scalability of this approach.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the hierarchical Bayesian model, we develop an alternative hierarchical framework that both improves scalability and more effectively incorporates the desired inductive bias.\nSpecifically, we introduce a low-dimensional latent variable, ei∈ℝde,ℝde≪ℝdεformulae-sequencesuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒much-less-thansuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝜀e^{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}},\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}}\\\\ll\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{\\\\varepsilon}}—which we refer to as the dynamical embedding—that maps to the space of dynamics parameters and encodes dataset-specific variations (Rusu et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib27 \"\")).\nThis approach enhances scalability and enables efficient few-shot learning, as it requires simply inferring the embedding given new data.\n\nThe generative model for this hierarchical SSM is then described as,\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | eisuperscript𝑒𝑖\\\\displaystyle e^{i} | ∼p​(e),similar-toabsent𝑝𝑒\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim p(e), |  | (8)

p\\_{\\\\phi^{i}}(y^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t}), |  | (10) |\n\nwhere we drop the prior over the shared dynamics parameter, θ𝜃\\\\theta, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the inference problem.\nSimilar to the hierarchical Bayesian model, all datasets share the same latent dynamics, θ𝜃\\\\theta, with the dataset-specific variation captured by the dynamical embedding, eisubscript𝑒𝑖e\\_{i}.\n\nNext, we expand on the functional form of the latent dynamics fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} conditioned on eisuperscript𝑒𝑖e^{i}.\nOur goal is to design fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} in a way that can effectively capture complex changes and disentangle underlying variability in dynamics across recordings, while simultaneously incentivizing the extraction of shared dynamical structure.\nWhile the simplest formulation would be using the embedding as an input to the dynamics model (Zintgraf et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib37 \"\"); Cotler et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib5 \"\")), we observed that this led to interference between dynamics as we increased the diversity of dynamical regimes (for example, Fig. [13](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F13 \"Figure 13 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nInstead, we use the dynamical embeddings to directly output changes to the parameters of the dynamics model via a hypernetwork, hϑsubscriptℎitalic-ϑh\\_{\\\\vartheta}, (Ha et al., [2016](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib13 \"\")), which facilitates increased expressivity when modeling conditional functions (Galanti & Wolf, [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib10 \"\")),\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |

To circumvent this issue, we use a sequential variational autoencoder (seqVAE) (Krishnan et al., [2015](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib17 \"\"))—an extension of variational autoencoders for state-space models—to learn the generative model by optimizing a lower-bound to the log marginal likelihood (commonly referred to as the ELBO).\nThe ELBO for y1:T1:Msubscriptsuperscript𝑦:1𝑀:1𝑇y^{1:M}\\_{1:T} is defined as,\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ℒ​(y1:T1:M)=∑t,m𝔼qα,β​\\[log⁡pϕi​(yti∣zti)\\]−𝔼qβ\\[𝔻K​L(qβ(zti∣y¯1:Ti,ei)\\|\\|pθ,ϑ(zti∣zt−1i,ei))\\]−𝔻K​L(qα(ei∣y¯1:Ti)\\|\\|p(ei))\\\\begin{split}\\\\mathcal{L}(y\\_{1:T}^{1:M})&=\\\\sum\\_{t,m}\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}}\\\\left\\[\\\\log p\\_{\\\\phi^{i}}(y^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t})\\\\right\\]\\\\\\<br>&\\\\quad-\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{\\\\beta}}\\\\left\\[\\\\mathbb{D}\\_{KL}(q\\_{\\\\beta}(z^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}^{i}\\_{1:T},e^{i})\\|\\|p\\_{\\\\theta,\\\\vartheta}(z^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t-1},e^{i}))\\\\right\\]-\\\\mathbb{D}\\_{KL}(q\\_{\\\\alpha}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i})\\|\\|p(e^{i}))\\\\end{split} |  | (15) |\n\nwhere qα​(ei∣y¯1:Ti)subscript𝑞𝛼conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖q\\_{\\\\alpha}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i}) and qβ​(zt∣y¯1:Ti,ei)subscript𝑞𝛽conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖q\\_{\\\\beta}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i},e^{i}) are the encoders for the dynamical embedding and latent state, respectively, and 𝔼qα,β≡𝔼qβ​(zt∣y¯1:Ti,ei)​qα​(ei∣y¯1:Ti)subscript𝔼subscript𝑞𝛼𝛽subscript𝔼subscript𝑞𝛽conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝑞𝛼conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta}}\\\\equiv\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{\\\\beta}(z\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i},e^{i})q\\_{\\\\alpha}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i})}.

As described in Sec. [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2 \"2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\"), one of the challenges with integrating recordings in a common latent space is different dimensionalities (number of recorded neurons) and\nthe dependence of neural activity on the shared latent space. The read-in network ensures that the latent states and dynamical-embeddings inferred from each dataset live in the same space.\n\nWe use the following parametrization of the inference networks (Krishnan et al., [2015](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib17 \"\")),\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | y¯ti=Ωi​(yti),superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscriptΩ𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑖\\\\displaystyle\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i}=\\\\Omega^{i}(y\\_{t}^{i}), |  | (16) |\n|  | qα​(ei∣y¯1:Ti)=𝒩​(ei∣μα​(y¯ti),σα2​(y¯ti)),subscript𝑞𝛼conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖𝒩conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝜇𝛼superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝜎2𝛼superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖\\\\displaystyle q\\_{\\\\alpha}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i})=\\\\mathcal{N}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\mu\\_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i}),\\\\sigma^{2}\\_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i})), |  | (17) |\n|  | qβ​(z1:Ti∣y¯1:Ti,ei)=∏t=1T𝒩​(zti∣μβ​(concat​(y¯ti,ei)),σβ2​(concat​(y¯ti,ei))),subscript𝑞𝛽conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑧:1𝑇𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑡1𝑇𝒩conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡𝑖subscript𝜇𝛽concatsuperscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝜎2𝛽concatsuperscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖\\\\displaystyle q\\_{\\\\beta}(z\\_{1:T}^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i},e^{i})=\\\\prod\\_{t=1}^{T}\\\\mathcal{N}(z\\_{t}^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\mu\\_{\\\\beta}(\\\\textrm{concat}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i},e^{i})),\\\\sigma^{2}\\_{\\\\beta}(\\\\textrm{concat}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i},e^{i}))), |  | (18) |\n\nwhere concat is the concatenation operation.

Example dynamics learned by the proposed approach when trained with M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets.\nB. Samples from the inferred dynamical embedding for each dataset (see eq.

Forecasting r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} at k-step=50 for models trained with M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets.\n\nAs a proof of concept,\nwe revisit the motivating example presented in Section [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S2 \"2 Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") as a means to validate the efficacy of our approach and investigate how it unifies dynamics across datasets.\nFor both M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets, we used an embedding dimensionality of 1 and allowed the network to make a\nrank-1 change to the dynamics parameters.\n\nAfter training, we observed that the shared dynamics (when e=0𝑒0e=0) converged to a limit cycle with a slow velocity (Fig. [3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S3.F3 \"Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A)—capturing the global topology that is shared across all datasets—and the model learned to modulate the velocity of the dynamics conditioned on the dynamical embedding which strongly correlated with the dataset specific velocity222Note that we plot the absolute embedding samples since the likelihood function can introduce arbitrary invariance such as direction flipping, rotation, and so on. (Fig [3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S3.F3 \"Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B).\nThis demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to capture dataset-specific variability.\nLastly, Fig. [3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S3.F3 \"Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to forecast well for both M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets. We include further validation experiments when there is no model mismatch as well as the generalization of the trained model to new data in Appendix [A](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A1 \"Appendix A Details of Motivating Experiment from Sections 2 and 3.3 ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\").\n\n## 4 Related Works\n\nMulti-Dataset Training in Neuroscience. Previous work has explored multi-dataset training for extracting latent representations in neuroscience. LFADS (Pandarinath et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib25 \"\")) used session-stitching, but focused on single-animal recordings. Linderman et al. ( [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib19 \"\")) used hierarchical Bayesian state-space models with switching linear dynamical systems, while Herrero-Vidal et al. ( [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib14 \"\")) developed a joint model with shared linear dynamics but dataset-specific likelihoods. In contrast to these approaches, we incorporate a more expressive dynamics function that disentangles variabilities across recording sessions. CEBRA (Schneider et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib30 \"\")) and CS-VAE (Yi et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib34 \"\")) extract latent representations but do not learn underlying dynamics. Recently, there has been growing interest in using diverse neural recordings for training large-scale foundation models in neuroscience (Ye et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib33 \"\"); Zhang et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib36 \"\"); Caro et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib3 \"\"); Azabou et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib1 \"\")). Our approach shares the same broad goal of pretraining a single model for rapid adaptation on downstream recordings; however, we focus on learning a dynamics model across recordings while these methods leverage transformer-based architectures that encode temporal information indirectly via positional embeddings.\n\nMeta-Learning.\nSeveral meta-learning approaches have been developed for few-shot adaptation, including gradient-based methods (Finn et al., [2017](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib9 \"\"); Li et al., [2017](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib18 \"\"); Nichol & Schulman, [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib24 \"\"); Zintgraf et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib37 \"\")). Amongst these, LEO (Rusu et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib27 \"\")) shares the same idea of meta-learning in low-dimensional space of parameter embeddings. However, gradient-based approaches require fine-tuning during test-time, and have had limited success for meta-learning dynamics.\nSimilar to our work (Cotler et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib5 \"\")) also learns an embedding space of dynamics learned from trained RNNs, however, we are interested in learning dynamics directly from data. Some methods for learning generalizable dynamics been previously proposed—DyAD (Wang et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib32 \"\")) adapts across environments by neural style transfer, however it operates on images of dynamical systems, LEADS (Yin et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib35 \"\")) learns a constrained dynamics function that is directly added to some base dynamics function, and CoDA (Kirchmeyer et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib16 \"\")) which learns task-specific parameter changes conditioned on a low-dimensional context similar to our approach. However, these approaches were applied in supervised settings on low-dimensional systems whereas we operate in an unsupervised setting.\n\n## 5 Experiments\n\nWe first validate the proposed method on synthetic data and then test our method on neural recordings from the primary motor and premotor cortex. We compare the proposed approach against the following baselines:\n\nSingle Session Model.\nWe train a separate model on each dataset.\nGiven sufficient training data, this should result in the best performance, but will fail in trial-limited regimes.\n\nMulti-Session Shared Dynamics.\nWe also consider a model that assumes the same dynamics with dataset-specific likelihoods (Pandarinath et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib25 \"\"); Herrero-Vidal et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib14 \"\")).\n\nEmbedding-Input. In this baseline, the embedding is provided as an additional input to the dynamics model. This is a similar formulation to CAVIA (Concat) (Zintgraf et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib37 \"\")) and DYNAMO (Cotler et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib5 \"\")).\n\nLinear Adapter.\nWe additionally test the hypernetwork parametrization proposed in CoDA (Kirchmeyer et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib16 \"\")), where the hypernetwork adapts all parameters as a linear function of the dynamical embedding.\n\nFor each experiment, we split each of the M𝑀M datasets into a training and test set and report reconstruction and forecasting metrics on the test set.\nTo measure the generalization performance, we also report these metrics on held-out datasets.\nFurther details on training and evaluation metrics can be found in Appendix [D](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A4 \"Appendix D Experiment Details ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\").\n\n### 5.1 Bifurcating Systems\n\nIn these experiments, we test whether our method could capture variations across multiple datasets, particularly in the presence of significant dynamical shifts, such as bifurcations commonly observed in real neural populations.\nTo test this, we chose two parametric classes of dynamical systems: i) a system undergoing a Hopf bifurication and, ii) the unforced Duffing system. We include the results for training on datasets generated only from the Hopf system in Appendix [B.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A2.SS1 \"B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") and discuss the results of jointly training on both systems here. We briefly outline the data generation process for the Duffing system (with data generation for Hopf included in Appendix [B.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A2.SS1 \"B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\nThe latent trajectories for the Duffing system were generated from a family of stochastic differential equations,\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | z1˙=z2+5​d​Wt,z2˙=ai​z2−z1​(bi+c​z12)+5​d​Wtformulae-sequence˙subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧25dsubscript𝑊𝑡˙subscript𝑧2superscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑧2subscript𝑧1superscript𝑏𝑖𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑧125dsubscript𝑊𝑡\\\\dot{z\\_{1}}=z\\_{2}+5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t},\\\\hskip 30.0pt\\\\dot{z\\_{2}}=a^{i}z\\_{2}-z\\_{1}(b^{i}+cz\\_{1}^{2})+5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t} |  | (19) |\n\nwith c=0.1𝑐0.1c=0.1, a,b∈ℝ𝑎𝑏ℝa,b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, and d​Wtdsubscript𝑊𝑡\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t} denoting the Wiener process.\nIn Fig. [4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F4 \"Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, we visualize how the dynamical system changes\nas a𝑎a and b𝑏b vary.\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454/assets/x4.png)Figure 4: A.

We report performance on 64 test trajectories from each dataset.\nWe used de=2subscript𝑑𝑒2d\\_{e}=2 for all embedding-conditioned approaches and constrained the hypernetwork to make rank dr=1superscript𝑑𝑟1d^{r}=1 changes for our approach.\n\nOur approach was able to learn a good approximation to the ground-truth dynamics of the Duffing oscillator system while disentangling different dynamical regimes (Fig. [4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F4 \"Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nApart from learning the underlying topology of dynamics, it also better captured the geometrical properties compared to other embedding-conditioned baselines (Fig. [12](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F12 \"Figure 12 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nWe observed similar results for datasets from the Hopf system–while our approach approximated the ground-truth system well, the Embedding-Input baseline displayed interference between dynamics and the Linear-Adapter learned a poor approximation to the ground-truth system (Fig. [13](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F13 \"Figure 13 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nConsequently, our approach outperformed other methods on forecasting observations with all methods having comparable reconstruction performance (Fig. [4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F4 \"Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B, C). Notably, apart from the desuperscript𝑑𝑒d^{e}, we used the same architecture as when training on only the Hopf datasets, and did not observe any drop in performance for our approach, in contrast to baselines (Fig. [10](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A2.F10 \"Figure 10 ‣ B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C (Bottom), Fig. [4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F4 \"Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C).\n\n|  | ns=1subscript𝑛𝑠1n\\_{s}=1 | ns=8subscript𝑛𝑠8n\\_{s}=8 | ns=16subscript𝑛𝑠16n\\_{s}=16 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Our Method | 0.69 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.072 | 0.78 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.051 | 0.87 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.037 |\n| Linear-Adapter | 0.68 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.08 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.026 | 0.74 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.039 |\n| Single Session | 0.47 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.119 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.014 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.047 |\n| Shared Dynamics | -0.31 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.103 | -0.34 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.086 | -0.13 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.065 |\n| Embedding-Input | 0.59 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.084 | 0.77 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.04 | 0.74 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.039 |\n\nTable 1: Few shot forecasting performance (k=30𝑘30k=30-step) on 3 held-out datasets as a function of nssubscript𝑛𝑠n\\_{s}, the number of trials used to learn dataset specific read-in network and likelihood.

The condition-averaged of latent dynamics projections generated by the model, along with the corresponding real and forecasted behavior.\n\nWe move on to testing the applicability of the proposed approach on neural data.\nWe use\nsingle and multi-unit neural population recordings from the motor and premotor cortex during two behavioral tasks–the Centre-Out (CO) and Maze reaching tasks (Perich et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib26 \"\"); Gallego et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib12 \"\"); Churchland et al., [2012](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib4 \"\")).\nIn the CO task, subjects are trained to use a manipulandum to reach one of eight target locations on a screen. In the Maze task, subjects use a touch screen to reach a target location, while potentially avoiding obstacles.\nThese recordings spanned different sessions, animals, and labs, and involved different behavioral modalities, while still having related behavioral components, making them a good testbed for evaluating various methods.\nFor training, we used 404040 sessions from the CO task, from subjects M and C, and 444 sessions from the Maze task from subjects Je and Ni. We set the dimensionality of latent dynamics to dz=30subscript𝑑𝑧30d\\_{z}=30, and used an embedding dimensionality of de=2subscript𝑑𝑒2d\\_{e}=2, for all embedding-conditioned dynamics models.\nFor our approach, we constrain the hypernetwork to make rank dr=6superscript𝑑𝑟6d^{r}=6 changes, although we verified that the performance was not sensitive to drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r} (Fig [15](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F15 \"Figure 15 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nAs a proxy for how well the various approaches learned the underlying dynamics, we report metrics on inferring the hand velocity using reconstructed and forecasted neural data from the models. Note that we align all recordings to the movement onset (details in Appendix [D](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A4 \"Appendix D Experiment Details ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\nThe inferred dynamical embedding displayed distinct structures across behavioral tasks and subjects (Fig. [5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F5 \"Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nWhile the CO task involves more stereotyped straight reaching behavior with the same stimulus conditions across datasets, the Maze task has more complex stimulus statistics which vary across sessions.\nThe family of learned dynamics reflected this heterogeneity across recordings, as visualized by the condition-averaged principal components (PCs) of the latent trajectories generated by the model (Fig. [5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F5 \"Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B).\n\nMany of the approaches had adequate performance\non reconstructing velocity from neural recordings, with our method and Linear Adapter outperforming single session reconstruction performance on the CO task (Fig. [6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F6 \"Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, top). However, the single-session models had the best performance on forecasting.\nSince we are using the same base architecture for all methods, this is expected given enough training data.\nNotably, our approach managed to balance learning both the CO and Maze tasks relative to other multi-session baselines, with all performing better on the CO task than the Maze (Fig. [6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F6 \"Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, bottom). Next, we tested if we can transfer these learned dynamics to new recordings as we varied nssubscript𝑛𝑠n\\_{s} from 8 to 64 trials for learning the read-in network and likelihood.\nWe used trials from 2 held-out sessions from Sub C and M, as well as 2 sessions from a new subject (Sub T) for evaluating all methods.\nWe observed that our approach consistently performed well on both reconstruction and forecasting for held-out sessions from previously seen subjects, and reached good performance on sessions from Sub T as we increased the training trials\n(Fig. [6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F6 \"Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B, C (ns=32subscript𝑛𝑠32n\\_{s}=32)).\nMoreover, our method outperformed all other baselines on forecasting, especially in very low-sample regimes, while having comparable reconstruction performance (Fig. [16](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F16 \"Figure 16 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454/assets/x6.png)Figure 6: A.

Behavior reconstruction (top) and forecasting (bottom) performance on held-out sessions and sessions from a new subject as a function of the number of training samples.\nC. Hand velocity trajectories (400 ms after movement onset) predicted by our approach on 17 test trials from held-out session (top) and 13 test trials from a session on a new subject (bottom), after using ns=32subscript𝑛𝑠32n\\_{s}=32 trials for aligning to the pre-trained model.\n\nWe further investigated the effect of large-scale training for sample-efficient transfer on downstream tasks by only pretraining the model on 128 trials from 4 sessions spanning different tasks and subjects.\nEven in this case, the embedding distribution displayed clear clustering based on the task and subject. Moreover, the model performed comparably to the Single-Session model on reconstruction, while outperforming it on prediction for both tasks (Fig. [17](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F17 \"Figure 17 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, B). However, it demonstrated poor performance on new sessions given limited trials for learning the read-in and likelihood parameters (Fig. [17](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F17 \"Figure 17 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C), underscoring the importance of large-scale training for generalizing to novel settings.\n\nFinally, we probed the differences in the latent state evolution given the same initial condition while interpolating across the learned embedding.\nIn order to do this, we chose an example session from the Maze and CO datasets and obtained their corresponding dynamical embedding from the model, shown as a solid blue and green circle in Fig. [7](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F7 \"Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") (middle), respectively.\nA grid of points was sampled around each of these inferred embeddings (shown as shaded squares in Fig. [7](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F7 \"Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") middle), and for each point we obtained the corresponding low-rank parameter changes to generate the latent trajectories.\nWe observed that the embedding space learned a continuous representation of dynamics, which was reflected in similar predicted behaviors close to the original learned embedding (Fig [7](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.F7 \"Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nInterestingly, when we interpolated through the entire embedding space, the predicted behavior and corresponding dynamics continuously varied as well.\nSpecifically, the predicted behavior and dynamics trajectories on the CO session demonstrated similarities over a large portion of the embedding space, with the trajectories shifting to more curved reaches further from the original embedding (Fig. [18](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F18 \"Figure 18 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nOn the Maze task, the trajectories demonstrated more heterogeneity in responses, and decayed to a fixed point further away from the original embedding(Fig. [19](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A3.F19 \"Figure 19 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454/assets/x7.png)Figure 7: The predicted behavior for a Maze (Sub Je) session and CO (Sub C) session at 9 grid points around the original inferred embedding. The point closest to the original embedding is highlighted in blue and green respectively.\n\n## 6 Discussion\n\nWe present a novel framework for jointly inferring and learning latent dynamics from heterogeneous neural recordings across sessions/subjects during related behavioral tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that facilitates learning a family of dynamical systems from heterogeneous recordings in a unified latent space, while providing a concise, interpretable manifold over dynamical systems.\nOur meta-learning approach mitigates the challenges of statistical inference from limited data, a common issue arising from the high flexibility of models used to approximate latent dynamics.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that the learned embedding manifold provides a useful inductive bias for learning from limited samples, with our proposed parametrization offering greater flexibility in capturing diverse dynamics while minimizing interference.\nWe observe that the generalization of our model depends on the amount of training data—when trained on smaller datasets, the model learns specialized solutions, whereas more data allows it to learn shared dynamical structures.\nThis work enhances our capability to integrate, analyze, and interpret complex neural dynamics across diverse experimental conditions, broadening the scope of scientific inquiries possible in neuroscience.\n\n### Limitations and Future Work\n\nOur current framework uses event aligned neural observations; in the future, it would be useful to incorporate task-related events, to broaden its applicability to complex, unstructured tasks. Further, the model’s generalization to novel settings depends on accurate embedding inference, a challenge noted in previous works that disentangle task inference and representation learning (Hummos et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib15 \"\")).\nWhile our latent dynamics parametrization is expressive, it assumes shared structure across related tasks. Future work could extend the model to accommodate recordings without expected shared structures (for instance, by adding modularity (Márton et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#bib.bib22 \"\"))). Investigating the performance of embedding-conditioned low-rank adaptation on RNN-based architectures presents another avenue for future research. Finally, the embedding manifold provides a map for interpolating across different dynamics. While we focus on rapid learning in this paper, our framework could have interesting applications for studying inter-subject variability, learning-induced changes in dynamics, or changes in dynamics across tasks in the future.\n\n## References\n\n- Azabou et al.

For our method and CoDA, we restricted parameter changes to the input, \\\\vWi​nsubscript\\\\vW𝑖𝑛\\\\vW\\_{in}, and hidden weights, \\\\vWh​hsubscript\\\\vWℎℎ\\\\vW\\_{hh}.

For the results reported in [B.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#A2.SS1 \"B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") and [5.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.05454#S5.SS1 \"5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\"), we used the Adam optimizer with weight decay and a Cosine annealing schedule on the learning rate for pretraining all approaches.\n\nMotor Cortex Recordings. We binned the spiking activity in 20ms bins and smoothed it with a 25ms Gaussian filter to obtain the rates for all datasets. We further removed neurons that had a firing rate of less than 0.1Hz and aligned the neural activity to movement onset. We used 512 trials when available or 80 percent of the trialsm, each of length 36, for training all methods.\n\nWe used the LAMB optimizer for pretraining all multi-session methods on the motor cortex recordings and used Adam with weight decay for the single-session models, with a Cosine annealing schedule on the learning rate in both cases. We also incorporated masking during training for all approaches to encourage learning better latent dynamics. Specifically, we sampled the latent state from the dynamics instead of the state inference network on randomly masked time bins to compute the likelihood.\n\nAligning New Data. We pretrained all multi-session approaches for 3 seeds and picked the best performing model to evaluate few-shot performance. When aligning new data to this pre-trained model, we trained the dataset-specific read-in network, ΩisuperscriptΩ𝑖\\\\Omega^{i} and likelihood functions pϕisuperscriptsubscript𝑝italic-ϕ𝑖p\\_{\\\\phi}^{i} for the new dataset, in addition to the state noise, Qisuperscript𝑄𝑖Q^{i}, by optimizing the ELBO for new data (eq.

We used Adam with weight decay for aligning, and additionally incorporated masking when aligning held-out motor cortex datasets.\n\n### D.2 Metrics\n\nSynthetic Experiments. We report the r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} on observation reconstruction for test trials over the entire length of the trial for all approaches. In order to evaluate the forecasting performance, we use observations till time t𝑡t and sample the corresponding latent trajectories, z0:tisubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖:0𝑡z^{i}\\_{0:t}, from the inference network and the corresponding eisuperscript𝑒𝑖e^{i} for the embedding-conditioned methods. We subsequently use the learned dynamics model to generate K steps ahead from zt+1:t+Kisubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖:𝑡1𝑡𝐾z^{i}\\_{t+1:t+K} and map these generated trajectories back to the observations. The k-step r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} for each dataset is computed as,\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | rk2=1−∑i=1M(yk−y^k)2∑i=1M(yk−y¯)2subscriptsuperscript𝑟2𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑘subscript^𝑦𝑘2superscriptsubscript𝑖1𝑀superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑘¯𝑦2r^{2}\\_{k}=1-\\\\frac{\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{M}(y\\_{k}-\\\\hat{y}\\_{k})^{2}}{\\\\sum\\_{i=1}^{M}(y\\_{k}-\\\\bar{y})^{2}} |  |\n\nwhere y¯¯𝑦\\\\bar{y} is the mean activity during the trial, and M𝑀M is the number of test trials.\n\nMotor Cortex Recordings. On the motor cortex experiments, we report behavior decoding from the reconstructed and forecasted observations for all methods. Specifically, for each session, we trained a linear behavior decoder from the neural observations to the hand velocity of the subject, assuming a uniform delay of 100ms between neural activity and behavior for all sessions.\n\nAfter training all methods, we use reconstructed observations from the test trials to evaluate the behavior reconstruction r2superscript𝑟2r^{2}. For evaluating the decoding performance from forecasted observations, we used the first 13 time bins (around time till movement onset) to estimate the latent state and embedding, and subsequently use the trained dynamics model to forecast the next 20 time bins. The observations corresponding tp these forecasted trajectories were used to evaluate the prediction r2superscript𝑟2r^{2}.\n\n### D.3 Hyperparameters\n\nSynthetic Examples.

      "content": "Latent variable models are widely used in neuroscience to extract dynamical structure underlying high-dimensional neural activity (Pandarinath et al., [2018]; Schimel et al., [2022]; Dowling et al., [2024]).\nWhile latent dynamics provide valuable insights into behavior and generate testable hypotheses of neural computation (Luo et al., [2023]; Nair et al., [2023]), they are typically inferred from a single recording session.\nAs a result, these models are sensitive to small variations in the underlying dynamics and exhibit limited generalization capabilities.\nIn parallel, a large body of work in machine learning has focused on training models from diverse datasets that can rapidly adapt to novel settings.\nHowever, there has been limited work on inferring generalizable dynamical systems from data, with existing approaches mainly applied to settings with known low-dimensional dynamics (Yin et al., [2021]; Kirchmeyer et al., [2022]).\n\nIntegrating noisy neural recordings from different animals and/or tasks for learning the underlying dynamics presents a unique set of challenges.\nThis is partly due to heterogeneities in recordings across sessions such as the number and tuning properties of recorded neurons, as well as different stimulus statistics and behavioral modalities across cognitive tasks.\nThis challenge is further compounded by the lack of inductive biases for disentangling the variabilities across dynamics into shared and dataset-specific components.\nRecent evidence suggests that learned latent dynamics underlying activity of task-trained biological and artificial neural networks demonstrate similarities when engaged in related tasks (Gallego et al., [2018]; Maheswaranathan et al., [2019]; Safaie et al., [2023]).\nIn a related line of work, neural networks trained to perform multiple cognitive tasks with overlapping cognitive components learn to reuse dynamical motifs, thereby facilitating few-shot adaptation on novel tasks (Turner & Barak, [2023]; Driscoll et al., [2024]).\n\nMotivated by these observations, we propose a novel framework for meta-learning latent dynamics from neural recordings.\nOur approach is to encode the variations in the latent dynamical structure present across neural recordings in a low-dimensional vector,\ne∈ℝde𝑒superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒e\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}},\nwhich we refer to as the dynamical embedding.\nDuring training, the model learns to adapt a common latent dynamical system model conditioned on the dynamical embedding.\nWe learn the dynamical embedding manifold from a diverse collection of neural recordings, allowing rapid learning of latent dynamics in the analysis of data-limited regime commonly encountered in neuroscience experiments.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. 1.\n\n\nWe propose a novel parameterization of latent dynamics that facilitates integration and learning of meta-structure over diverse neural recordings.\n\n2. 2.\n\n\nWe develop an inference scheme to jointly infer the embedding and latent state trajectory, as well as the corresponding dynamics model directly from data.\n\n3. 3.\n\n\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our method on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting for synthetic datasets and motor cortex recordings obtained during different reaching tasks.\n\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: A. Neural recordings display heterogeneities in the number and tuning properties of recorded neurons and reflect diverse behavioral responses. The low-dimensional embedding manifold captures this diversity in dynamics.\nB. Our method learns to adapt a common latent dynamics conditioned on the embedding via low-rank changes to the model parameters.",

While we have a-priori knowledge of the source of variations in dynamics for this example, this is typically not the case with real neural recordings.\nTherefore, we develop an approach for inferring the variation across recordings and use it to define a solution space of related dynamical systems (Fig. [1]Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).",

This decomposition of latent dynamics explicitly introduces an inductive bias that encourages θ𝜃\\\\theta and εisuperscript𝜀𝑖\\\\varepsilon^{i} to capture the shared and dataset-specific dynamical structure respectively.\nWhile this formulation is appealing, the equal dimensionality of εisuperscript𝜀𝑖\\\\varepsilon^{i} and θ𝜃\\\\theta could lead the model to overly rely on dataset-specific terms. Additionally, using DNNs for modeling latent dynamics introduces a large number of parameters, thereby limiting the scalability of this approach.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the hierarchical Bayesian model, we develop an alternative hierarchical framework that both improves scalability and more effectively incorporates the desired inductive bias.\nSpecifically, we introduce a low-dimensional latent variable, ei∈ℝde,ℝde≪ℝdεformulae-sequencesuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒much-less-thansuperscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝑒superscriptℝsubscript𝑑𝜀e^{i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}},\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{e}}\\\\ll\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\_{\\\\varepsilon}}—which we refer to as the dynamical embedding—that maps to the space of dynamics parameters and encodes dataset-specific variations (Rusu et al., [2019]).\nThis approach enhances scalability and enables efficient few-shot learning, as it requires simply inferring the embedding given new data.\n\nThe generative model for this hierarchical SSM is then described as,\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | eisuperscript𝑒𝑖\\\\displaystyle e^{i} | ∼p​(e),similar-toabsent𝑝𝑒\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim p(e), |  | (8) |\n|  | zti∣zt−1i,eiconditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖𝑡1superscript𝑒𝑖\\\\displaystyle z^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t-1},e^{i} | ∼𝒩​(zti∣fθ​(zt−1i,ei),Qi),similar-toabsent𝒩conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡1𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖superscript𝑄𝑖\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left(z\\_{t}^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}f\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\_{t-1}^{i},e^{i}),Q^{i}\\\\right), |  | (9) |\n|  | yti∣zticonditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖𝑡\\\\displaystyle y^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t} | ∼pϕi​(yti∣zti),similar-toabsentsubscript𝑝superscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖conditionalsubscriptsuperscript𝑦𝑖𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑧𝑖𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\phi^{i}}(y^{i}\\_{t}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}z^{i}\\_{t}), |  | (10) |\n\nwhere we drop the prior over the shared dynamics parameter, θ𝜃\\\\theta, significantly reducing the dimensionality of the inference problem.\nSimilar to the hierarchical Bayesian model, all datasets share the same latent dynamics, θ𝜃\\\\theta, with the dataset-specific variation captured by the dynamical embedding, eisubscript𝑒𝑖e\\_{i}.\n\nNext, we expand on the functional form of the latent dynamics fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} conditioned on eisuperscript𝑒𝑖e^{i}.\nOur goal is to design fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta} in a way that can effectively capture complex changes and disentangle underlying variability in dynamics across recordings, while simultaneously incentivizing the extraction of shared dynamical structure.\nWhile the simplest formulation would be using the embedding as an input to the dynamics model (Zintgraf et al., [2019];

As described in Sec. [2]Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\"), one of the challenges with integrating recordings in a common latent space is different dimensionalities (number of recorded neurons) and\nthe dependence of neural activity on the shared latent space. The read-in network ensures that the latent states and dynamical-embeddings inferred from each dataset live in the same space.\n\nWe use the following parametrization of the inference networks (Krishnan et al., [2015]),\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | y¯ti=Ωi​(yti),superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscriptΩ𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑖\\\\displaystyle\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i}=\\\\Omega^{i}(y\\_{t}^{i}), |  | (16) |\n|  | qα​(ei∣y¯1:Ti)=𝒩​(ei∣μα​(y¯ti),σα2​(y¯ti)),subscript𝑞𝛼conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖𝒩conditionalsuperscript𝑒𝑖subscript𝜇𝛼superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝜎2𝛼superscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖\\\\displaystyle q\\_{\\\\alpha}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i})=\\\\mathcal{N}(e^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\mu\\_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i}),\\\\sigma^{2}\\_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i})), |  | (17) |\n|  | qβ​(z1:Ti∣y¯1:Ti,ei)=∏t=1T𝒩​(zti∣μβ​(concat​(y¯ti,ei)),σβ2​(concat​(y¯ti,ei))),subscript𝑞𝛽conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑧:1𝑇𝑖superscriptsubscript¯𝑦:1𝑇𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖superscriptsubscriptproduct𝑡1𝑇𝒩conditionalsuperscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡𝑖subscript𝜇𝛽concatsuperscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝜎2𝛽concatsuperscriptsubscript¯𝑦𝑡𝑖superscript𝑒𝑖\\\\displaystyle q\\_{\\\\beta}(z\\_{1:T}^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\bar{y}\\_{1:T}^{i},e^{i})=\\\\prod\\_{t=1}^{T}\\\\mathcal{N}(z\\_{t}^{i}\\\\mathchoice{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\!\\\\mid\\\\!}{\\\\mid}{\\\\mid}\\\\mu\\_{\\\\beta}(\\\\textrm{concat}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i},e^{i})),\\\\sigma^{2}\\_{\\\\beta}(\\\\textrm{concat}(\\\\bar{y}\\_{t}^{i},e^{i}))), |  | (18) |\n\nwhere concat is the concatenation operation.

Forecasting r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} at k-step=50 for models trained with M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets.\n\nAs a proof of concept,\nwe revisit the motivating example presented in Section [2]Challenges with Jointly Learning Dynamics across Datasets ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") as a means to validate the efficacy of our approach and investigate how it unifies dynamics across datasets.\nFor both M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets, we used an embedding dimensionality of 1 and allowed the network to make a\nrank-1 change to the dynamics parameters.\n\nAfter training, we observed that the shared dynamics (when e=0𝑒0e=0) converged to a limit cycle with a slow velocity (Fig. [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A)—capturing the global topology that is shared across all datasets—and the model learned to modulate the velocity of the dynamics conditioned on the dynamical embedding which strongly correlated with the dataset specific velocity222Note that we plot the absolute embedding samples since the likelihood function can introduce arbitrary invariance such as direction flipping, rotation, and so on. (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B).\nThis demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to capture dataset-specific variability.\nLastly, Fig. [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 Proof of Concept ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to forecast well for both M=2𝑀2M=2 and M=20𝑀20M=20 datasets.

      "content": "Multi-Dataset Training in Neuroscience. Previous work has explored multi-dataset training for extracting latent representations in neuroscience. LFADS (Pandarinath et al., [2018]) used session-stitching, but focused on single-animal recordings. Linderman et al. ( [2019]) used hierarchical Bayesian state-space models with switching linear dynamical systems, while Herrero-Vidal et al. ( [2021]) developed a joint model with shared linear dynamics but dataset-specific likelihoods. In contrast to these approaches, we incorporate a more expressive dynamics function that disentangles variabilities across recording sessions. CEBRA (Schneider et al., [2023]) and CS-VAE (Yi et al., [2022]) extract latent representations but do not learn underlying dynamics. Recently, there has been growing interest in using diverse neural recordings for training large-scale foundation models in neuroscience (Ye et al., [2023]; Zhang et al., [2023]; Caro et al., [2024]; Azabou et al., [2024]). Our approach shares the same broad goal of pretraining a single model for rapid adaptation on downstream recordings; however, we focus on learning a dynamics model across recordings while these methods leverage transformer-based architectures that encode temporal information indirectly via positional embeddings.\n\nMeta-Learning.\nSeveral meta-learning approaches have been developed for few-shot adaptation, including gradient-based methods (Finn et al., [2017]; Li et al., [2017]; Nichol & Schulman, [2018]; Zintgraf et al., [2019]). Amongst these, LEO (Rusu et al., [2019]) shares the same idea of meta-learning in low-dimensional space of parameter embeddings. However, gradient-based approaches require fine-tuning during test-time, and have had limited success for meta-learning dynamics.\nSimilar to our work (Cotler et al., [2023]) also learns an embedding space of dynamics learned from trained RNNs, however, we are interested in learning dynamics directly from data. Some methods for learning generalizable dynamics been previously proposed—DyAD (Wang et al., [2022]) adapts across environments by neural style transfer, however it operates on images of dynamical systems, LEADS (Yin et al., [2021]) learns a constrained dynamics function that is directly added to some base dynamics function, and CoDA (Kirchmeyer et al., [2022]) which learns task-specific parameter changes conditioned on a low-dimensional context similar to our approach. However, these approaches were applied in supervised settings on low-dimensional systems whereas we operate in an unsupervised setting.",

      "content": "We first validate the proposed method on synthetic data and then test our method on neural recordings from the primary motor and premotor cortex. We compare the proposed approach against the following baselines:\n\nSingle Session Model.\nWe train a separate model on each dataset.\nGiven sufficient training data, this should result in the best performance, but will fail in trial-limited regimes.\n\nMulti-Session Shared Dynamics.\nWe also consider a model that assumes the same dynamics with dataset-specific likelihoods (Pandarinath et al., [2018]; Herrero-Vidal et al., [2021]).\n\nEmbedding-Input. In this baseline, the embedding is provided as an additional input to the dynamics model. This is a similar formulation to CAVIA (Concat) (Zintgraf et al., [2019]) and DYNAMO (Cotler et al., [2023]).\n\nLinear Adapter.\nWe additionally test the hypernetwork parametrization proposed in CoDA (Kirchmeyer et al., [2022]), where the hypernetwork adapts all parameters as a linear function of the dynamical embedding.\n\nFor each experiment, we split each of the M𝑀M datasets into a training and test set and report reconstruction and forecasting metrics on the test set.\nTo measure the generalization performance, we also report these metrics on held-out datasets.\nFurther details on training and evaluation metrics can be found in Appendix [D]Appendix D Experiment Details ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\").\n\n### 5.1 Bifurcating Systems\n\nIn these experiments, we test whether our method could capture variations across multiple datasets, particularly in the presence of significant dynamical shifts, such as bifurcations commonly observed in real neural populations.\nTo test this, we chose two parametric classes of dynamical systems: i) a system undergoing a Hopf bifurication and, ii) the unforced Duffing system. We include the results for training on datasets generated only from the Hopf system in Appendix [B.1]B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") and discuss the results of jointly training on both systems here. We briefly outline the data generation process for the Duffing system (with data generation for Hopf included in Appendix [B.1]B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\nThe latent trajectories for the Duffing system were generated from a family of stochastic differential equations,\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | z1˙=z2+5​d​Wt,z2˙=ai​z2−z1​(bi+c​z12)+5​d​Wtformulae-sequence˙subscript𝑧1subscript𝑧25dsubscript𝑊𝑡˙subscript𝑧2superscript𝑎𝑖subscript𝑧2subscript𝑧1superscript𝑏𝑖𝑐superscriptsubscript𝑧125dsubscript𝑊𝑡\\\\dot{z\\_{1}}=z\\_{2}+5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t},\\\\hskip 30.0pt\\\\dot{z\\_{2}}=a^{i}z\\_{2}-z\\_{1}(b^{i}+cz\\_{1}^{2})+5\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t} |  | (19) |\n\nwith c=0.1𝑐0.1c=0.1, a,b∈ℝ𝑎𝑏ℝa,b\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}, and d​Wtdsubscript𝑊𝑡\\\\mathrm{d}W\\_{t} denoting the Wiener process.\nIn Fig. [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, we visualize how the dynamical system changes\nas a𝑎a and b𝑏b vary.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: A.

Mean reconstruction and forecasting r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} of the observations for all datasets used for pretraining on test trials.\n\nWe chose M=20𝑀20M=20 pairs of (ai,bi)superscript𝑎𝑖superscript𝑏𝑖(a^{i},b^{i}) values (Fig [11]Figure 11 ‣ B.2 Duffing System ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")), and generated latent trajectories of length T=300𝑇300T=300.\nObservations were generated according to yti∼𝒩​(Ci​zti,0.01​𝕀)similar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝑦𝑡𝑖𝒩superscript𝐶𝑖superscriptsubscript𝑧𝑡𝑖0.01𝕀y\\_{t}^{i}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{N}(C^{i}z\\_{t}^{i},0.01\\\\mathbb{I});\nthe dimensionality of the observations varied between 30 and 100.\nIn addition to these 20 datasets, we included 11 datasets from the Hopf system (Appendix [B.2]B.2 Duffing System ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")), and used 128 trajectories from each of these 31 datasets for training all methods. We report performance on 64 test trajectories from each dataset.\nWe used de=2subscript𝑑𝑒2d\\_{e}=2 for all embedding-conditioned approaches and constrained the hypernetwork to make rank dr=1superscript𝑑𝑟1d^{r}=1 changes for our approach.\n\nOur approach was able to learn a good approximation to the ground-truth dynamics of the Duffing oscillator system while disentangling different dynamical regimes (Fig. [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nApart from learning the underlying topology of dynamics, it also better captured the geometrical properties compared to other embedding-conditioned baselines (Fig. [12]Figure 12 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nWe observed similar results for datasets from the Hopf system–while our approach approximated the ground-truth system well, the Embedding-Input baseline displayed interference between dynamics and the Linear-Adapter learned a poor approximation to the ground-truth system (Fig. [13]Figure 13 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nConsequently, our approach outperformed other methods on forecasting observations with all methods having comparable reconstruction performance (Fig. [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B, C). Notably, apart from the desuperscript𝑑𝑒d^{e}, we used the same architecture as when training on only the Hopf datasets, and did not observe any drop in performance for our approach, in contrast to baselines (Fig. [10]Figure 10 ‣ B.1 Hopf Bifurcation ‣ Appendix B Synthetic Bifurcating Systems ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C (Bottom), Fig. [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C).\n\n|  | ns=1subscript𝑛𝑠1n\\_{s}=1 | ns=8subscript𝑛𝑠8n\\_{s}=8 | ns=16subscript𝑛𝑠16n\\_{s}=16 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Our Method | 0.69 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.072 | 0.78 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.051 | 0.87 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.037 |\n| Linear-Adapter | 0.68 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.08 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.026 | 0.74 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.039 |\n| Single Session | 0.47 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.119 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.014 | 0.79 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.047 |\n| Shared Dynamics | -0.31 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.103 | -0.34 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.086 | -0.13 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.065 |\n| Embedding-Input | 0.59 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.084 | 0.77 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.04 | 0.74 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.039 |\n\nTable 1: Few shot forecasting performance (k=30𝑘30k=30-step) on 3 held-out datasets as a function of nssubscript𝑛𝑠n\\_{s}, the number of trials used to learn dataset specific read-in network and likelihood. (±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 1 s.e.m)\n\nNext, we tested the few-shot performance of all methods on new datasets, two generated from the Duffing oscillator system and one from the Hopf system, as a function of nssubscript𝑛𝑠n\\_{s}, the number of trials used for learning the dataset specific read-in network, ΩisuperscriptΩ𝑖\\\\Omega^{i} and likelihood.\nOur approach and the Linear-Adapter demonstrated comparable forecasting performance when using ns=1subscript𝑛𝑠1n\\_{s}=1 and ns=8subscript𝑛𝑠8n\\_{s}=8 training trajectories.\nHowever, with ns=16subscript𝑛𝑠16n\\_{s}=16 training trials, unlike other methods, our approach continued to improved and outperformed them (Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 5.1 Bifurcating Systems ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nThis could be explained by looking at the inferred embedding on held-out datasets—as we increased the number of training trajectories, the model was able to consistently align to the “correct” embedding (Fig. [14]Figure 14 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\n### 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Visualizing the embedding manifold.\nA. Each point corresponds to a sample from the inferred embedding distribution (see eq. [17]In 3.2 Inference and Learning ‣ 3 Integrating Neural Recordings for Meta-Learning Dynamics ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")) corresponding to each recording.\nB. The condition-averaged of latent dynamics projections generated by the model, along with the corresponding real and forecasted behavior.\n\nWe move on to testing the applicability of the proposed approach on neural data.\nWe use\nsingle and multi-unit neural population recordings from the motor and premotor cortex during two behavioral tasks–the Centre-Out (CO) and Maze reaching tasks (Perich et al., [2018]; Gallego et al., [2020]; Churchland et al., [2012]).\nIn the CO task, subjects are trained to use a manipulandum to reach one of eight target locations on a screen. In the Maze task, subjects use a touch screen to reach a target location, while potentially avoiding obstacles.\nThese recordings spanned different sessions, animals, and labs, and involved different behavioral modalities, while still having related behavioral components, making them a good testbed for evaluating various methods.\nFor training, we used 404040 sessions from the CO task, from subjects M and C, and 444 sessions from the Maze task from subjects Je and Ni. We set the dimensionality of latent dynamics to dz=30subscript𝑑𝑧30d\\_{z}=30, and used an embedding dimensionality of de=2subscript𝑑𝑒2d\\_{e}=2, for all embedding-conditioned dynamics models.\nFor our approach, we constrain the hypernetwork to make rank dr=6superscript𝑑𝑟6d^{r}=6 changes, although we verified that the performance was not sensitive to drsuperscript𝑑𝑟d^{r} (Fig [15]Figure 15 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nAs a proxy for how well the various approaches learned the underlying dynamics, we report metrics on inferring the hand velocity using reconstructed and forecasted neural data from the models. Note that we align all recordings to the movement onset (details in Appendix [D]Appendix D Experiment Details ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\nThe inferred dynamical embedding displayed distinct structures across behavioral tasks and subjects (Fig. [5]Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A).\nWhile the CO task involves more stereotyped straight reaching behavior with the same stimulus conditions across datasets, the Maze task has more complex stimulus statistics which vary across sessions.\nThe family of learned dynamics reflected this heterogeneity across recordings, as visualized by the condition-averaged principal components (PCs) of the latent trajectories generated by the model (Fig. [5]Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B).\n\nMany of the approaches had adequate performance\non reconstructing velocity from neural recordings, with our method and Linear Adapter outperforming single session reconstruction performance on the CO task (Fig. [6]Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, top). However, the single-session models had the best performance on forecasting.\nSince we are using the same base architecture for all methods, this is expected given enough training data.\nNotably, our approach managed to balance learning both the CO and Maze tasks relative to other multi-session baselines, with all performing better on the CO task than the Maze (Fig. [6]Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, bottom). Next, we tested if we can transfer these learned dynamics to new recordings as we varied nssubscript𝑛𝑠n\\_{s} from 8 to 64 trials for learning the read-in network and likelihood.\nWe used trials from 2 held-out sessions from Sub C and M, as well as 2 sessions from a new subject (Sub T) for evaluating all methods.\nWe observed that our approach consistently performed well on both reconstruction and forecasting for held-out sessions from previously seen subjects, and reached good performance on sessions from Sub T as we increased the training trials\n(Fig. [6]Figure 6 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") B, C (ns=32subscript𝑛𝑠32n\\_{s}=32)).\nMoreover, our method outperformed all other baselines on forecasting, especially in very low-sample regimes, while having comparable reconstruction performance (Fig. [16]Figure 16 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 6: A. (top) r2superscript𝑟2r^{2} for hand velocity decoding from reconstructed and (bottom) forecasted neural observations for Maze and Centre-Out sessions.\nB. Behavior reconstruction (top) and forecasting (bottom) performance on held-out sessions and sessions from a new subject as a function of the number of training samples.\nC. Hand velocity trajectories (400 ms after movement onset) predicted by our approach on 17 test trials from held-out session (top) and 13 test trials from a session on a new subject (bottom), after using ns=32subscript𝑛𝑠32n\\_{s}=32 trials for aligning to the pre-trained model.\n\nWe further investigated the effect of large-scale training for sample-efficient transfer on downstream tasks by only pretraining the model on 128 trials from 4 sessions spanning different tasks and subjects.\nEven in this case, the embedding distribution displayed clear clustering based on the task and subject. Moreover, the model performed comparably to the Single-Session model on reconstruction, while outperforming it on prediction for both tasks (Fig. [17]Figure 17 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") A, B). However, it demonstrated poor performance on new sessions given limited trials for learning the read-in and likelihood parameters (Fig. [17]Figure 17 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") C), underscoring the importance of large-scale training for generalizing to novel settings.\n\nFinally, we probed the differences in the latent state evolution given the same initial condition while interpolating across the learned embedding.\nIn order to do this, we chose an example session from the Maze and CO datasets and obtained their corresponding dynamical embedding from the model, shown as a solid blue and green circle in Fig. [7]Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") (middle), respectively.\nA grid of points was sampled around each of these inferred embeddings (shown as shaded squares in Fig. [7]Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\") middle), and for each point we obtained the corresponding low-rank parameter changes to generate the latent trajectories.\nWe observed that the embedding space learned a continuous representation of dynamics, which was reflected in similar predicted behaviors close to the original learned embedding (Fig [7]Figure 7 ‣ 5.2 Motor Cortex Recordings ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nInterestingly, when we interpolated through the entire embedding space, the predicted behavior and corresponding dynamics continuously varied as well.\nSpecifically, the predicted behavior and dynamics trajectories on the CO session demonstrated similarities over a large portion of the embedding space, with the trajectories shifting to more curved reaches further from the original embedding (Fig. [18]Figure 18 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\nOn the Maze task, the trajectories demonstrated more heterogeneity in responses, and decayed to a fixed point further away from the original embedding(Fig. [19]Figure 19 ‣ Appendix C Additional Figures ‣ Meta-Dynamical State Space Models for Integrative Neural Data Analysis\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 7: The predicted behavior for a Maze (Sub Je) session and CO (Sub C) session at 9 grid points around the original inferred embedding.

      "content": "We present a novel framework for jointly inferring and learning latent dynamics from heterogeneous neural recordings across sessions/subjects during related behavioral tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that facilitates learning a family of dynamical systems from heterogeneous recordings in a unified latent space, while providing a concise, interpretable manifold over dynamical systems.\nOur meta-learning approach mitigates the challenges of statistical inference from limited data, a common issue arising from the high flexibility of models used to approximate latent dynamics.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that the learned embedding manifold provides a useful inductive bias for learning from limited samples, with our proposed parametrization offering greater flexibility in capturing diverse dynamics while minimizing interference.\nWe observe that the generalization of our model depends on the amount of training data—when trained on smaller datasets, the model learns specialized solutions, whereas more data allows it to learn shared dynamical structures.\nThis work enhances our capability to integrate, analyze, and interpret complex neural dynamics across diverse experimental conditions, broadening the scope of scientific inquiries possible in neuroscience.\n\n### Limitations and Future Work\n\nOur current framework uses event aligned neural observations; in the future, it would be useful to incorporate task-related events, to broaden its applicability to complex, unstructured tasks. Further, the model’s generalization to novel settings depends on accurate embedding inference, a challenge noted in previous works that disentangle task inference and representation learning (Hummos et al., [2024]).\nWhile our latent dynamics parametrization is expressive, it assumes shared structure across related tasks. Future work could extend the model to accommodate recordings without expected shared structures (for instance, by adding modularity (Márton et al., [2021])). Investigating the performance of embedding-conditioned low-rank adaptation on RNN-based architectures presents another avenue for future research. Finally, the embedding manifold provides a map for interpolating across different dynamics. While we focus on rapid learning in this paper, our framework could have interesting applications for studying inter-subject variability, learning-induced changes in dynamics, or changes in dynamics across tasks in the future.",

            "content": "Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in the context of large-scale pretrained models like GPT \\[ [1]), [2]), [3]), [4])\\], have showcased the immense potential of scaling up, both the terms of the size of datasets and models \\[ [5]), [6])\\]. Similarly, in neuroscience, there is a growing need for a foundational model that can bridge the gaps between diverse datasets, experiments, and individuals, allowing for a more holistic understanding of brain function and information processing \\[ [7])\\]. The development of such a model would allow researchers to uncover underlying patterns and interactions within neural populations \\[ [8])\\], and potentially allow for more robust decoding of brain states.\n\nHowever, creating a large-scale neural decoding model that can effectively combine spiking datasets from various sources is a complex challenge \\[ [9])\\].\nOne of the central challenges is the lack of a shared “vocabulary” in neural recordings.\nUnlike the case for text—wherein every document written in a given language shares a basic lexicon for tokenization—there is no one-to-one correspondence between neurons in different individuals.\nAs such, every recording from a different individual involves a unique set of neurons that cannot be easily aligned with another set.\nAn additional core challenge lies in the inherent variability of neuron sets observed across different days \\[ [10])\\].\nEven when monitoring the same individual, variability in electrode/tissue interface can lead to distinct neuron sets which, despite advanced sorting methods, can\nlead to inconsistencies in input channels across sessions \\[ [11]), [12]), [9])\\].\nOverall, this lack of correspondence across recordingscomplicates the integration of information from different experiments and individuals, ultimately hampering efforts to construct a unified perspective on population-level interactions and dynamics in the brain.\n\nIn response to these challenges, we propose a new framework for large-scale training on neural spiking data called POYO (Pre-training On manY neurOns).111Poyo is the exclamation used by Kirby, who has an insatiable appetite. Similarly, POYO consumes spikes from many neural datasets and combines them into one unified model. This framework is designed to enable scalable and efficient training across multiple sessions of neural recordings, even when spanning different sets of neurons with no known correspondence. Our approach centers around a novel tokenization scheme that transforms individual neural action potentials, or “spikes”, into discrete tokens, thereby preserving the neural code’s finest temporal structure while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency. The resulting tokenization not only allows for a more effective representation of neural activity but also paves the way for training on larger volumes of data. We combine this input tokenization method with an architecture that builds on the PerceiverIO \\[ [13])\\] to compress the input spikes into a latent space and learns interactions across spikes in time and across neurons.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed approach on data from over 158 sessions from open electrophysiology datasets from seven non-human primates (NHPs), spanning over 27,373 units and 100 hours of recordings. We demonstrate that through pretraining on large amounts of data, we can transfer with very few samples (few-shot learning) and thus improve overall brain decoding performance.\nOur work not only presents an innovative framework for training large models on neuroscience datasets, but also offers insights into the scaling laws that govern decoding from neural populations. By enabling the development of large pretrained models for neural decoding, our approach advances the field of brain-machine interfaces and other decoding applications.\n\nThe main contributions of this work include:\n\n- •\n\n\nA framework for large-scale training on neural recordings: We present a novel framework for training transformer models end-to-end on multi-session and across-individual electrophysiology datasets derived from neural populations, enabling efficient and effective decoding from a diverse range of neural recordings.\n\n- •\n\n\nInnovative spike-based tokenization strategies: We introduce a fundamentally different way to tokenize neural population activity. Our approach tokenizes individual spikes (events) across neural populations, preserving fine temporal structure and enhancing computational efficiency by adopting a sparse representation of the data.\n\n- •\n\n\nPre-trained models for neural decoding: We build two large pretrained models (POYO-1, POYO-mp) that can be fine-tuned on new sessions and across recordings from different animals and new behavioral tasks. We will make the weights and code available, and provide both pretrained models as a resource to the community.",

            "content": "The transformer architecture \\[ [14])\\], originally introduced in the context of natural language processing (NLP), has shown remarkable flexibility and effectiveness in various domains, especially in the presence of large and diverse datasets \\[ [15]), [3])\\]. In this work, we explore how to leverage this versatility in the neural data domain.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Overview of our approach. Input spike tokens are compressed into a smaller set of latent tokens which are processed through multiple self-attention blocks, finally time-varying outputs are predicted by querying the latent space. All tokens in this model are assigned a timestamp, which are used towards rotary position encoding.\n\n### 2.1 Tokenizing neural population activity\n\nNeurons communicate asynchronously using electrical impulses called spikes. The timing and frequency of spikes encode signals that convey information about the external world and coordinate the internal dialogue within the brain. In many neuroscience experiments, neural activity is recorded from the brain through multiple electrodes, and then processed \\[ [16])\\] to extract the spiking events for a set of neural “units” \\[ [17])\\].222We use the term units instead of neurons because recordings may include both single-units (isolated neurons) and multi-units (contain spikes from multiple neurons).\nThe resulting data are multi-variate event-based sequences that are typically very sparse relative to the number of recorded time points.\n\nNeurons and their spikes are of course not independent of one another. Rather, they are part of a complex, interwoven tapestry of neural activity, with each spike contributing to a collective dialogue across billions of neurons. The true challenge and opportunity lie in interpreting these spikes not in isolation, but in the context of this broader “conversation.”\n\nWhen trying to scale up and train on many sessions of data, we are faced with the challenge of having recordings of neural conversations with completely different set of “speakers” for which we don’t know the identity or their functional tuning (or what they respond to). This is because each time we record from the brain, we are tuning into a conversation between a new set of speakers.\nHowever, as with language, there is some reason to think that neurons are ultimately communicating on similar topics, e.g. sensations from the external world, internal states of the body, muscle commands, etc. In other words, the lexicon may be different, but everyone is talking about similar subjects.\nDespite the variability of our data, our aim is to decipher these “conversations” in a way that generalizes to new neural datasets without fixed or known correspondence across their inputs.\n\n##### The neural tokenizer.\n\nBased upon these motivations, we propose a novel approach for tokenizing neural population activity where each spike is represented as a token (see Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 2 Approach ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")). In this case, each token can be defined in terms of which unit it came from (via a learnable embedding) and the time that the spike event was detected. By representing our data in this way, we never define or fix the expected number of units, and the model can ingest populations of arbitrary size, and thus can be trained across many datasets.\nAt the same time, this approach also avoids having to specify a specific time resolution for the neural code, as is the case with binning, and gets rid of the accumulation of a lot of sparse tokens containing no events.\n\nMore concretely, we assign each unit a unique identifier and a corresponding D𝐷D-dimensional learnable embedding. Let UnitEmbed​(⋅)UnitEmbed⋅\\\\mathrm{UnitEmbed}(\\\\cdot) denote a lookup table that associates each unit to its unit embedding. Akin to word embeddings that encode semantic meaning and relationship between words, the unit embedding space encodes something about the “speaker’s” identity and role in neural computation.\nA unit fires a sequence of spikes in a context window of time \\[0,T\\]0𝑇\\[0,T\\]. Each spike will be represented by a token characterized by (𝐱i,ti)subscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝑡𝑖(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{i},t\\_{i}), where\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝐱i=UnitEmbed​(spike​i′​s​unit)subscript𝐱𝑖UnitEmbedspikesuperscripti′sunit\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{i}=\\\\mathrm{UnitEmbed}(\\\\rm{spike~{}i^{\\\\prime}s~{}unit}) |  |\n\nis the learned embedding associated with the unit that emitted the spike and tisubscript𝑡𝑖t\\_{i} is the event timestamp.\n\nCollectively, and for an arbitrary set of units, we combine all the spikes into a sequence of length M𝑀M. The neural population activity is represented by \\[𝐱1,…,𝐱M\\]subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑀\\[\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{1},\\\\dots,\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{M}\\] and their corresponding times \\[t1,…,tM\\]subscript𝑡1…subscript𝑡𝑀\\[t\\_{1},\\\\ldots,t\\_{M}\\]. While the size of our context window T𝑇T stays fixed, M𝑀M will vary depending on the number of units in the population and their firing rates (see Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 2 Approach ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")). Note that all spikes from a specific unit have the same unit embedding, and only differ in their timing.\n\n### 2.2 Building the latent space\n\nCompressing the input sequence. Rather than processing the input sequences with self-attention, which is quadratic in sequence length and can be expensive for long sequences, we use a perceiver encoder module \\[ [18])\\] that summarizes the input sequence into a shortened “latent” sequence.\nLet’s consider a sequence of M𝑀M input tokens 𝐗=\\[𝐱1,…,𝐱M\\]𝐗subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑀\\\\mathbf{X}=\\[{\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{M}}\\] and a sequence of learned latent tokens 𝐙0=\\[𝐳0,1,…,𝐳0,N\\]subscript𝐙0subscript𝐳01…subscript𝐳0𝑁\\\\mathbf{Z}\\_{0}=\\[{\\\\mathbf{z}\\_{0,1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{z}\\_{0,N}}\\], where 𝐳0,i∈ℝDsubscript𝐳0𝑖superscriptℝ𝐷\\\\mathbf{z}\\_{0,i}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{D} and N≪Mmuch-less-than𝑁𝑀N\\\\ll M.\nWe use cross-attention to pull information from the input sequence into a compressed latent sequence. The queries 𝐐=𝐖q​𝐙0𝐐subscript𝐖𝑞subscript𝐙0{\\\\bf Q}={\\\\bf W}\\_{q}{\\\\bf Z}\\_{0} are a projection of the learned latent tokens 𝐙0subscript𝐙0{\\\\bf Z}\\_{0} and the keys and values are a projection of the input tokens: 𝐊=𝐖k​𝐗𝐊subscript𝐖𝑘𝐗{\\\\bf K}={\\\\bf W}\\_{k}{\\\\bf X} and 𝐕=𝐖v​𝐗𝐕subscript𝐖𝑣𝐗{\\\\bf V}={\\\\bf W}\\_{v}{\\\\bf X}, respectively. The cross-attention operation can be expressed as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |

Z}\\_{L}=\\[\\\\mathbf{z}\\_{L,1},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{z}\\_{L,N}\\].\n\n### 2.3 Encoding relative timing information\n\nTo incorporate timing information, we leverage rotary position encoding (RoPE) \\[ [19])\\] across all attention layers in the architecture. Unlike traditional position encoding methods that inject absolute position information into the token’s embedding, RoPE applies a rotation operation in the query, key embedding space, allowing each token in a sequence to attend to others based on its relative positional information.\n\nRecall that each input token i𝑖i has an associated timestamp tisubscript𝑡𝑖t\\_{i}. We will also assign a timestamp to each of the latent tokens: we divide the latent tokens into groups of equal size and spread each group uniformly over the context window \\[0,T\\]0𝑇\\[0,T\\].\nThis method allows us to capture temporal relationships between the latent tokens and the input tokens, enabling a temporal understanding of the encoded sequence. By distributing the latent tokens evenly within the context window \\[0,T\\]0𝑇\\[0,T\\], we create a structured temporal representation, which preserves and propagates temporal information all the way through the model. A detailed formulation of the relative encoding can be found in Appendix [A.1]A.1 Rotary position encoding ‣ Appendix A Additional Model Details ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\").\n\n### 2.4 Querying the latent space\n\nHaving built a latent space which can encode and model any population of units, we now want a flexible way to readout behavioral variables.\nThe output of the latent encoder is the latent sequence of size N𝑁N, while the desired output can be any arbitrary sequence of length P𝑃P. Let us consider the task of hand velocity decoding for example, in the context window \\[0,T\\]0𝑇\\[0,T\\], the length of the output sequence will depend on the sampling frequency. Since we aspire to train on datasets sourced from various labs, the sampling rate can differ significantly. We thus need a flexible mechanism for predicting outputs of varying lengths and querying from the neural activity at specific points in time.\n\nWe define a sequence of output tokens 𝐘0=\\[𝐲0,1,⋯,𝐲0,P\\]subscript𝐘0subscript𝐲01⋯subscript𝐲0𝑃\\\\mathbf{Y}\\_{0}=\\[\\\\mathbf{y}\\_{0,1},\\\\cdots,\\\\mathbf{y}\\_{0,P}\\], where P𝑃P is the number of output time points, which can change across sequences. Each output token is defined by (𝐲0,i,tio​u​t)subscript𝐲0𝑖subscriptsuperscript𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑖(\\\\mathbf{y}\\_{0,i},t^{out}\\_{i}). Initially all the output tokens within a session are set to the same learned embedding

|\n\n𝐘0subscript𝐘0\\\\mathbf{Y}\\_{0}𝐙Lsubscript𝐙𝐿\\\\mathbf{Z}\\_{L}\n\nSince we use rotatary embeddings, and both the latent and output tokens have assigned timestamps, the querying mechanism can leverage the relative position of latent and output tokens to extract the temporally relevant context that enable prediction of the behavioral variable of interest.\n\nSession embeddings.  To account for variability of the experimental setups in real world settings, we propose to define a learnable session embedding which captures the hidden experimental variables. This information is injected into the output query 𝐲0subscript𝐲0\\\\mathbf{y}\\_{0}, where again we use a lookup table to register each new session we encounter.\nTo illustrate how we probe the model to generate an output, we can think about it as asking a question of the form:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | \"Predict \\[BEHAVIOR\\] at time \\[TIMESTAMP\\] under the experimental conditions of \\[SESSION ID\\]\". |  |\n\nThis produces a set of output tokens of the dimension of the number of queries which we then pass through an MLP to generate the behavioral variables of the desired dimension (e.g., 2D for hand velocities in a planar movement task).\n\n### 2.5 Unit identification in new sessions\n\nOur design of the unit embedding space allows our model to learn latent information about the units it encounters, as well as capture the relationship between units in the population. Given a new recording with unidentified units, we can transfer our model by mapping these new units into the unit embedding space.\nTo do this, we introduce an approach that we call “unit identification”, which leverages gradient descent to learn the embeddings of new units. In this approach, we freeze all existing weights of the model and simply add new rows to the UnitEmbed​(⋅)UnitEmbed⋅\\\\mathrm{UnitEmbed}(\\\\cdot) lookup table for each of the new units, as well as a new session embedding.\nNotably, the bulk of our model which maps the neural population activity to behavior is unchanged and is simply transferred to the new dataset. In our experiments, we find that this approach is surprisingly effective and allows us to rapidly integrate new datasets into the same underlying model. Further details and analysis on the robustness of this approach are presented in Appendix [C.2]C.2 Robustness of Unit-identification ‣ Appendix C Additional Results ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\").\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Study | Regions | \\# Indiv | \\# Sess | \\# Units | \\# In | \\# Out | Tasks |\n| Perich et al. \\[ [20]), [21]), [22]), [23])\\] | M1, PMd | 4 | 117 | 11,557 | 143M | 20M | CO, RT |\n| Churchland et al. \\[ [24])\\] | M1 | 2 | 9 | 1,728 | 706M | 87M | CO |\n| Makin et al. \\[ [25])\\] | M1, S1 | 2 | 47 | 14,899 | 123M | 15M | RT |\n| Flint et al. \\[ [26])\\] | M1 | 1 | 5 | 957 | 7.9M | 0.3M | CO |\n| NLB-Maze \\[ [27])\\] | M1 | 1 | 1 | 182 | 3.6M | 6.8M | Maze |\n| NLB-RTT \\[ [27])\\] | M1 | 1 | 1 | 130 | 1.5M | 2.8M | RT |\n\nTable 1: Datasets used in this work.

(A) Center-out reach and (B) Random target task \\[ [20])\\], along with examples of true and predicted behavior (x,y velocities). In (C-D), we show the decoding performance for single-session models (gray) and the POYO-mp multi-session model (green).\n\n### 3.1 Datasets and experiment setup\n\nOne of the key advantages of our approach is its ability to scale to handle large amounts of neural data, including sessions from different numbers of neurons, across different tasks and recording setups, and from different animals. Thus we set out to build a diverse dataset large enough to test our approach. We curated a multi-lab dataset with electrophysiological recordings from motor cortical regions, where neural population activity has been extensively studied \\[ [10])\\], and deep learning tools and benchmarks have recently been established \\[ [27])\\].\nIn total, we aggregated 178 sessions worth of data, spanning 29,453 units from the primary motor (M1), premotor (PMd), and primary somatosensory (S1) regions in the cortex of 9 nonhuman primates (see Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 2.5 Unit identification in new sessions ‣ 2 Approach ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")). We place this in the context of standard analyses within a single lab or paper which typically involve 10’s of sessions and a few hundred neurons.\n\nAll of these neural recordings were collected while the animals performed various motor tasks that vary in their inherent complexity (see Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\") A-B). The center-out (CO) task is relatively stereotyped, with the animal making a reach to one of eight targets after receiving a go cue, and then returning to the center. In contrast, the random target (RT) task is significantly more complex. The animals make continuous and self-paced movements with new targets appearing in succession at random locations in the workspace. In addition to the greater exploration of the workspace and heterogeneity in movments, this task allows individual to plan their next movement while finishing the execution of the current movement leading to greater complexity in neural dynamics. Other sources of variability that we find across labs include the: choice of pre-processing algorithms (spike sorting or threshold crossing analysis), type of controller (manipulandum, touch screen), and sampling rate when recording behavior (100Hz to 1kHz). We do not re-process the data or attempt to standardize it across labs or tasks.\nFurther details on the datasets are provided in Appendix [B]Appendix B Datasets ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\").\n\nExperiment setup. Throughout all of our experiments, we use a context window of 1​s1𝑠1s and do not segment data into trials during training. We only use the trial structure when reporting the decoding performance, in particular, center-out sessions are evaluated during the reaching movement. We train the model with N=512𝑁512N=512 latent tokens and a dimension D=128𝐷128D=128. We use the LAMB optimizer \\[ [28])\\], and employ a cosine decay of the learning rate at the end of training. For every session, we holdout 20%percent2020\\\\% of the trials for testing, and 10%percent1010\\\\% for validation. We use 1-GPU and 8-GPU setups for single-session and multi-session models, respectively. All details can be found in Appendix [A]Appendix A Additional Model Details ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\").\n\n### 3.2 Testing the model on single sessions\n\nTo first investigate the performance of our architecture when trained on a single session, we trained single-session models on 100 different recording sessions acquired from three nonhuman primates (Monkey C, Monkey M, Monkey Ja), each containing anywhere from 10 to 106 minutes of data.\nIn all of these recordings, the same behavioral task setup, behavioral recording apparatus (10 ms temporal resolution), and spike sorting procedure was used.\n\nAcross all 100 single-session models, we obtained an average R2 of 0.9347 on CO and 0.8402 for RT sessions. When we compared these single-session results with existing models for neural decoding, including a Wiener Filter, GRU and MLP \\[ [29])\\], we found that our approach consistently outperforms these baselines, with even greater improvements observed on the RT task. Additionally, we found that our single-session models are stable for a wide range of hyperparameters (Appendix [C.3]C.3 Hyperparameter sensitivity ‣ Appendix C Additional Results ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")).\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Same animal, New day | New animal |\n|  | Method | Monkey C - CO (2) | Monkey T - CO (6) | Monkey T - RT (6) |\n| Fromscratch | Wiener Filter | 0.8860 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0149 | 0.6387 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0283 | 0.5922 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0901 |\n| GRU | 0.9308 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0257 | 0.8041 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0232 | 0.6967 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.1011 |\n| MLP | 0.9498±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0119 | 0.8577±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0242 | 0.7467±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0771 |\n| POYO-\\[Single-session\\] | 0.9682±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0111 | 0.9194±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0185 | 0.7800±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0702 |\n| Pre-trained | POYO-mp \\+ Unit ID | 0.9675 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0079 | 0.9012 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0271 | 0.7759 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0471 |\n| POYO-mp \\+ Finetune | 0.9708±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0116 | 0.9379±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0193 | 0.8105±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0561 |\n| POYO-1 \\+ Unit ID | 0.9677 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0096 | 0.9028 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0248 | 0.7788 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0548 |\n| POYO-1 \\+ Finetune | 0.9683±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0118 | 0.9364±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0132 | 0.8145±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.0496 |\n\nTable 2: Behavioral decoding results across neural recordings from four nonhuman primates performing two different tasks. All the baselines and the single-session model are trained from scratch, while POYO-mp and POYO-1 are pretrained. The standard deviation is reported over the sessions. The number of sessions in each dataset is contained in (⋅)⋅(\\\\cdot) and the top performing models in each category are indicated in boldface (first) and underlined (second).\n\n### 3.3 POYO-mp: Building a large pretrained across-animal, multi-session model\n\nTo investigate the question of how training with more sessions of data can improve brain decoding,\nwe trained a large model (POYO-mp, 24 layers) on all 100 sessions that we studied in our single-session analysis.\nIn total, we used 9,789 units and 4,367 neuron-hours (number of neurons ×\\\\times amount of time recorded) to train our POYO-mp model.\n\nThis model achieves an average test R2superscriptR2\\\\mathrm{R}^{2} of 0.9512 on the center-out tasks and 0.8738 on the random target tasks, which is a marked improvement over the single-session average.\nWhen we compared the performance of our multi-session model to single-session models head-to-head (see Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\") C-D), we found that across the board, multi-session training improves over single-sessions, and we observed even greater improvements for datasets with fewer trials (indicated by the size of the circles in the plot).\nOn RT sessions, we observe an even bigger improvement over the single session models. These results suggest that there are significant benefits in joint-training across multiple sessions, especially when decoding more complex behaviors like the random target task.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Scaling curves.R2superscriptR2\\\\mathrm{R}^{2} is evaluated and averaged over the test splits on both CO and RT tasks. The single-session performance is the mean over 100 different models.\n\n##### Scaling analysis.\n\nBy enabling multi-session training, we can start to ask questions about the extent to which having more data or more parameters can improve decoding (Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.3 POYO-mp: Building a large pretrained across-animal, multi-session model ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")). Thus, we studied the improvements obtained for three different depths of models, with L=6 (3.8M), L=14 (7.4M), and L=26 (13M) layers (parameters). For both CO and RT tasks, we find that even at the same depth (L=6), our 1 multi-session model shows an improvement over the average performance of 100 single-session models. We see further improvements with increasing the model depth, with the RT task benefiting even further from scaling. When we fix the model depth to L=6, and study how training jointly with more data contributes to improvement in performance, we find an improvement in performance when comparing single-session training (average 1.2M tokens) to training jointly on all RT sessions (26M tokens). When we also train jointly with other CO sessions (134M tokens in total), and increase model depth to help in accommodating the more growing and diverse training set, we continue seeing improvement in the decoding performance on RT sessions, accumulating to 4% over our single-session baseline.\n\n### 3.4 Transferring to new sessions\n\nAfter pretraining, we can then test on new sessions with unknown neurons using either the (i) unit identification approach we described in Section [2.5]Unit identification in new sessions ‣ 2 Approach ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\"), or (ii) full finetuning of the model weights. Recall that when we use a unit identification approach, we freeze the weights of the model and only learn new unit and session embeddings.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Sample and compute efficiency for training, unit identification, and fine-tuning approaches. On the left, we show the sample and compute efficiency for a heldout CO session. On the right, we plot the sample and compute efficiency for a new animal not seen during training.\n\n##### Results on held out sessions from the same animals.\n\nWe first tested the unit identification approach on held-out sessions from Monkey C that are unseen during training (Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 3.2 Testing the model on single sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\"), Left). In this case, we don’t have correspondence between units in the training and the testing conditions. Surprisingly, we find that we can achieve comparable performance with unit identification on the pretrained model (0.9675) with that of the single-session models trained fully from scratch (0.9682). With further finetuning of the rest of the model’s weights, we can improve the accuracy further (0.9708) to go beyond the accuracy of the single-session models.\nThis highlights the robustness of our model and its flexibility to accommodate fresh data with even a simple input mapping (unit identification).\n\nWe compare with the single session model and a GRU baseline (Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 3.4 Transferring to new sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\") A) with our multi-session model trained on the same number of trials. Both our single-session and finetuning approach achieve good performance scaling as we increase the number of samples, with the finetuning maintaining a gap over the single session models over the entire sampling space.\n\nResults on a new animal performing the same tasks.\nNext we tested our model on 12 sessions from a completely new animal (6 CO sessions, 6 RT sessions from Monkey T) that was not included in the training of the model (Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 3.2 Testing the model on single sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\"), Right).\nWhen we applied our unit identification approach on the multi-session model (POYO-mp \\+ Unit ID), we see a bit of a dip in overall accuracy from the single-session model (POYO-\\[Single-session\\]); however, when we fine-tune the weights of the model further, we achieve an accuracy of 0.9379 on CO, which is a significant improvement over all of the other baselines. For the RT task, the single session model is 0.7569 and with unit identification we achieve 0.7669 and with full fine-tuning we get up to 0.7916 (Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 3.4 Transferring to new sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\") B). These results are promising and show that we can use our pretrained model on new animals with a few minutes worth of labeled data.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Method | NLB-Maze | NLB-RTT |\n| From scratch | Wiener Filter | 0.7485 | 0.5438 |\n| GRU | 0.8887 | 0.5951 |\n| MLP | 0.8794 | 0.6953 |\n| AutoLFADS + Linear \\[ [30])\\] | 0.9062 | 0.5931 |\n| NDT + Linear \\[ [31])\\] | 0.8929 | 0.5895 |\n| NDT-Sup \\[ [32])\\] | 0.8708 | 0.4621 |\n| EIT \\[ [32])\\] | 0.8791 | 0.4691 |\n| POYO-\\[Single-session\\] | 0.9470 | 0.6850 |\n| Pretrained | POYO-mp \\+ Unit ID | 0.8962 | 0.7107 |\n| POYO-mp \\+ Finetune | 0.9466 | 0.7318 |\n| POYO-1 \\+ Unit ID | 0.9329 | 0.7294 |\n| POYO-1 \\+ Finetune | 0.9482 | 0.7378 |\n\nTable 3: Behavioral decoding results for datasets from the Neural Latents Benchmark \\[ [27])\\]. Best performing model is in bold and second best model is underlined.\n\nPerformance on the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB).  To understand how well our pre-trained model performs on data collected from new animals performing novel tasks with different equipment (example: touch screen vs. manipulandum), we applied our pretrained model to the MC-Maze (Monkey L) and MC-RTT (Monkey I) datasets from the NLB (Table [3]Table 3 ‣ Results on held out sessions from the same animals. ‣ 3.4 Transferring to new sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\"))\\[ [27])\\]. The NLB serves as a benchmark for neural representation learning and decoding and thus we can include other single-session baselines to our comparisons, including self-supervised models AutoLFADS \\[ [30])\\] and NDT \\[ [31])\\] which produce denoised firing rate estimates over which we fit a linear decoder (+ Linear), a supervised variant of NDT \\[ [32])\\] (NDT-Sup), and EIT \\[ [32])\\]. Both datasets contain single sessions from new animals performing movement tasks that we haven’t seen during training.\n\nOn the NLB-Maze dataset, we obtain a R2 of 0.8952 after unit identification, which is competitive with the baselines. These results are surprising since we do not modify the model’s weights, and yet our pretrained model yields competitive results on a dataset collected under very different conditions. When we finetune the model, we boost the performance even further establishing a 4.4% gap over the best baseline. Similar trends can be observed for the RTT task (Monkey I), with even larger (2%) improvement after finetuning.\n\n### 3.5 POYO-1: A multi-lab, multi-task model for neural decoding\n\nGiven the impressive transfer results of POYO-mp to datasets from different labs, we ask whether we can use our approach to build a model that spans even more diverse recording setups that we expect to encounter when trying to unify data from many sources.\nIn total, we used datasets from seven nonhuman primates spanning three different labs, with a total of 27,373 units and 16,473 neuron-hours for training our model. We call this pretrained multi-lab, multi-task model POYO-1.\n\nEven in light of the high amounts of variability across these different datasets, POYO-1 provides consistent improvements over the single-session models (Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 3.5 POYO-1: A multi-lab, multi-task model for neural decoding ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\") C).\nWhen tested on a number of different transfer tasks (Tables [2]Table 2 ‣ 3.2 Testing the model on single sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\"), [3]Table 3 ‣ Results on held out sessions from the same animals. ‣ 3.4 Transferring to new sessions ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding\")), we again find that the unit identification and finetuning approaches provide effective strategies for adapting our pretrained model to new datasets. We obtain notable performance on the NLB-Maze, where we find that we obtain a R2superscriptR2\\\\mathrm{R}^{2} of 0.9329 with only unit identification remapping, an almost 4% improvement over the unit identification result for our POYO-mp pretrained model, suggesting that we cover more of the task space with POYO-1.\n\nWhen comparing the POYO-1 model with POYO-mp model, it is clear that both methods have their strengths. POYO-mp excels on the datasets sourced from the same lab, with 0.8788 on RT sessions compared to POYO-1’s 0.8664. On the other hand, both models exhibit great transfer capabilities, with POYO-1 having the edge especially when using unit identification, indicating its ability to generalize better across diverse experimental conditions. This flexibility and scalability make these methods promising tools for future research in analyzing neural data from diverse sources.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Scaling up to more tasks and diverse neural and behavioral recording conditions.

This analysis revealed clusters corresponding to different data sources and tasks, suggesting that our model has not only learned to identify patterns within each session but also recognized overarching structures across sessions. In particular, we find that the datasets collected in the Miller Lab (C,M,J) used to train the POYO-mp model are mapped into similar regions of the session latent space, and (I and L) sessions are mapped to their own distinct clusters.",

The key to their success lies in the self-attention mechanism \\[ [14])\\], which allows the model to weigh the importance of each time step in the input sequence when producing an output. A typical approach in applying transformers to time-series data involves discretizing the continuous time domain into discrete bins \\[ [34])\\], and treating the binned data as a sequence of tokens. Each bin is then linearly projected into a high-dimensional embedding, which is input to the transformer model. The Perceiver framework \\[ [18]), [13])\\] moves away from the idea of patches, by directly processing the input bytes, using cross-attention layers to reduce the complexity of attention.\nIn addition to regular timeseries, there has been interest in applying transformers to model irregular timeseries including event stream and point process data \\[ [35]), [36]), [37])\\]. However, many of these models work on univariate event streams and when they extend to multivariate cases, they assume fixed and known input channels.\n\nTransformers applied to neural data.\nWith the recent advances in transformers for sequence modeling in many different time-series, transformers have also recently found successful applications in building representations of neural population activity \\[ [31]), [32]), [38])\\]. In these models, the spiking activity is first binned and then the estimated bin counts are tokenized.\nIn the neural data transformer (NDT) model \\[ [31])\\], the firing rates of all neurons in the population are embedded jointly in one token (time step or bin). In the embedded interaction transformer (EIT) \\[ [39])\\], neurons are considered independently in one stage of processing and at a population level in a second stage, and thus the whole dataset is tokenized over both neurons and time. In the spatiotemporal (STNDT) model \\[ [38])\\], two different tokenizations are also considered, one in space and one in time and two representations are learned jointly for both tokenization. In all cases, binned data are used and the models are trained on a single session and fixed set of neurons.\n\nMulti-session training and alignment. The idea of fitting a model to multiple sessions has been explored in previous work \\[ [40]), [41]), [42])\\], but build on the assumption that these sessions are recorded from the same subject in the same brain region (and same chronic implant), and assume that the subject is engaging in a single task with stereotyped structure. To our knowledge, we are the first to show that training not only across subjects but on data from different sources, is possible. A large number of these works do not have a mechanism for training jointly on many sessions at once, but rather propose post-training alignment-based approaches for transferring across recording days, a model trained on one session \\[ [43]), [23]), [44]), [12]), [45]), [46])\\].\nLFADS \\[ [40])\\] can be trained on multi-day sessions, but requires an initialization of the alignment matrix for each session, and has only been demonstrated during a single task in the same subject.\nAutoLFADS \\[ [30])\\] extends the LFADS framework with Population Based Training \\[ [47])\\] to perform hyperparameter tuning, but has not been demonstrated for multi-session alignment.",

To tackle the challenges of training on such large heterogeneous sources, we introduce a novel spike-level tokenization scheme and architecture that enables the model to learn from populations with varying numbers of neurons. We show that training a single unified model on multiple recordings is possible, and find that it leads to improved decoding performance.\nFinally, we build two large pretrained models (POYO-1, POYO-mp) that can be efficiently fine-tuned on new datasets, and make them available as a resource to the community.\n\nIn contrast to models trained on a single dataset, the pretrained models that we have developed provide a potential way to compare and contrast datasets, and also understand common motifs of activity and dynamics that may be shared across different sessions and individuals.\nThus, it will be critical to develop\ntools to probe the patterns and motifs learned by such models and characterize the neural mechanisms underlying different tasks and computations.\nIn particular, we look to understand how spike tokens are grouped across different latent tokens and how the dynamics of the population are modeled in this latent space. Additionally, our proposed unit embedding space allows us to map units into a high-dimensional space; thus understanding how unit projections are organized might help reveal the similarities between different neurons and the nature of their interactions. Similarly, we can analyse the session embeddings to glean insights into inter-session and across-animal differences.\n\nOur work shows how pretraining on diverse data, including datasets from animals performing different tasks and across different laboratories, can all help to improve our ability to decode from novel and unseen neural datasets. Already, our results demonstrate the positive effect of scale for neural data analysis.\nHowever, to scale this approach further and integrate even more diverse brain regions and tasks, it will be critical to move toward a self-supervised objective.\nThus, our current architecture and multi-session framework could be also extended to self-supervised tasks like generative next event prediction or masked modeling to allow for even larger datasets to be ingested.\n\nThis framework has the potential to advance neuroscience research in several ways. By enabling the development of large pretrained models that can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, the framework can accelerate progress in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and disease modeling applications. The ability to quickly and effectively decode neural activity from diverse datasets and modalities can have significant implications for improving our understanding of the brain and developing new therapeutic interventions.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank: Patrick Mineault for providing a lot of great feedback on the work, and Jingyun Xiao for helping to run baselines for NLB.\nThis project was supported by NIH award 1R01EB029852-01, NSF award IIS-2146072 as well as generous gifts from the Alfred Sloan Foundation (ED), the McKnight Foundation (ED), and the CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars Program (ED).\nBAR acknowledges support from NSERC (Discovery Grant: RGPIN-2020-05105; Discovery Accelerator Supplement: RGPAS-2020-00031; Arthur B.

            "content": "Recurrent neural network language models (rnnlms, Mikolov et al., [2011])) represent the state of the art in unsupervised generative modeling for natural language sentences. In supervised settings, rnnlm decoders conditioned on task-specific features are the state of the art in tasks like machine translation (Sutskever et al., [2014]); Bahdanau et al., [2015])) and image captioning (Vinyals et al., [2015]); Mao et al., [2015]); Donahue et al., [2015])). The rnnlm generates sentences word-by-word based on an evolving distributed state representation, which makes it a probabilistic model with no significant independence assumptions, and makes it capable of modeling complex distributions over sequences, including those with long-term dependencies. However, by breaking the model structure down into a series of next-step predictions, the rnnlm does not expose an interpretable representation of global features like topic or of high-level syntactic properties.\n\nWe propose an extension of the rnnlm that is designed to explicitly capture such global features in a continuous latent variable. Naively, maximum likelihood learning in such a model presents an intractable inference problem. Drawing inspiration from recent successes in modeling images (Gregor et al., [2015])), handwriting, and natural speech (Chung et al., [2015])), our model circumvents these difficulties using the architecture of a _variational autoencoder_ and takes advantage of recent advances in variational inference (Kingma and Welling, [2015]); Rezende et al., [2014])) that introduce a practical training technique for powerful neural network generative models with latent variables.\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| i went to the store to buy some groceries . |\n| i store to buy some groceries . |\n| i were to buy any groceries . |\n| horses are to buy any groceries . |\n| horses are to buy any animal . |\n| horses the favorite any animal . |\n| horses the favorite favorite animal . |\n| horses are my favorite animal . |\n\nTable 1:\n\nSentences produced by greedily decoding from points between two sentence encodings with a conventional autoencoder.

For this task, we introduce a novel evaluation strategy using an adversarial classifier, sidestepping the issue of intractable likelihood computations by drawing inspiration from work on non-parametric two-sample tests and adversarial training. In this setting, our model’s global latent variable allows it to do well where simpler models fail.\nWe finally introduce several qualitative techniques for analyzing the ability of our model to learn high level features of sentences.

            "content": "### 2.1 Unsupervised sentence encoding\n\nA standard rnn language model predicts each word of a sentence conditioned on the previous word and an evolving hidden state.\nWhile effective, it does not learn a vector representation of the full sentence.\nIn order to incorporate a continuous latent sentence representation, we first need a method to map between sentences and distributed representations that can be trained in an unsupervised setting.\nWhile no strong generative model is available for this problem, three non-generative techniques have shown promise: sequence autoencoders, skip-thought, and paragraph vector.\n\nSequence autoencoders have seen some success in pre-training sequence models for supervised downstream tasks (Dai and Le, [2015])) and in generating complete documents (Li et al., [2015a])). An autoencoder consists of an encoder function φe​n​csubscript𝜑𝑒𝑛𝑐\\\\varphi\\_{enc} and a probabilistic decoder model p​(x\\|z→=φe​n​c​(x))𝑝conditional𝑥→𝑧subscript𝜑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑥p(x\\|\\\\vec{z}=\\\\varphi\\_{enc}(x)), and maximizes the likelihood of an example x𝑥x conditioned on z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z}, the learned code for x𝑥x. In the case of a sequence autoencoder, both encoder and decoder are rnns and examples are token sequences.\n\nStandard autoencoders are not effective at extracting for global semantic features. In Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"), we present the results of computing a path or _homotopy_ between the encodings for two sentences and decoding each intermediate code. The intermediate sentences are generally ungrammatical and do not transition smoothly from one to the other. This suggests that these models do not generally learn a smooth, interpretable feature system for sentence encoding. In addition, since these models do not incorporate a prior over z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z}, they cannot be used to assign probabilities to sentences or to sample novel sentences.\n\nTwo other models have shown promise in learning sentence encodings, but cannot be used in a generative setting: Skip-thought models (Kiros et al., [2015])) are unsupervised learning models that take the same model structure as a sequence autoencoder, but generate text conditioned on a neighboring sentence from the target text, instead of on the target sentence itself.\nFinally, paragraph vector models (Le and Mikolov, [2014])) are non-recurrent sentence representation models. In a paragraph vector model, the encoding of a sentence is obtained by performing gradient-based inference on a prospective encoding vector with the goal of using it to predict the words in the sentence.\n\n### 2.2 The variational autoencoder\n\nThe variational autoencoder (vae, Kingma and Welling, [2015]); Rezende et al., [2014])) is a generative model that is based on a regularized version of the standard autoencoder. This model imposes a prior distribution on the hidden codes z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} which enforces a regular geometry over codes and makes it possible to draw proper samples from the model using ancestral sampling.\n\nThe vae modifies the autoencoder architecture by replacing the deterministic function φe​n​csubscript𝜑𝑒𝑛𝑐\\\\varphi\\_{enc} with a learned posterior _recognition model_, q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x). This model parametrizes an approximate posterior distribution over z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} (usually a diagonal Gaussian) with a neural network conditioned on x𝑥x. Intuitively, the vae learns codes not as single points, but as soft ellipsoidal _regions_ in latent space, forcing the codes to fill the space rather than memorizing the training data as isolated codes.\n\nIf the vae were trained with a standard autoencoder’s reconstruction objective, it would learn to encode its inputs deterministically by making the variances in q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x) vanishingly small (Raiko et al., [2015])). Instead, the vae uses an objective which encourages the model to keep its posterior distributions close to a prior p​(z→)𝑝→𝑧p(\\\\vec{z}), generally a standard Gaussian (μ=0→𝜇→0\\\\mu=\\\\vec{0}, σ=1→𝜎→1\\\\sigma=\\\\vec{1}). Additionally, this objective is a valid lower bound on the true log likelihood of the data, making the vae a generative model. This objective takes the following form:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ℒ​(θ;x)=−kl(qθ(z→\\|x)\\|\\|p(z→))+𝔼qθ​(z→\\|x)​\\[log⁡pθ​(x\\|z→)\\]≤log⁡p​(x).\\\\begin{split}\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta;x)&=-\\\\textsc{kl}(q\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\vec{z}\\|x)\\|\\|p(\\\\vec{z}))\\\\\\<br>&~{}~{}~{}~{}~{}+\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{\\\\theta}(\\\\vec{z}\\|x)}\\[\\\\log p\\_{\\\\theta}(x\\|\\\\vec{z})\\]\\\\\\<br>&\\\\leq\\\\log p(x)\\\\;\\\\;.\\\\end{split} |  | (1) |\n\nThis forces the model to be able to decode plausible sentences from every point in the latent space that has a reasonable probability under the prior.\n\nIn the experiments presented below using vae models, we use diagonal Gaussians for the prior and posterior distributions p​(z→)𝑝→𝑧p(\\\\vec{z}) and q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x), using the Gaussian reparameterization trick of Kingma and Welling ( [2015])). We train our models with stochastic gradient descent, and at each gradient step we estimate the reconstruction cost using a single sample from q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x), but compute the kl divergence term of the cost function in closed form, again following Kingma and Welling ( [2015])).",

            "content": "![Refer to caption]Figure 1: The core structure of our variational autoencoder language model. Words are represented using a learned dictionary of embedding vectors.\n\nWe adapt the variational autoencoder to text by using single-layer lstmrnns (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, [1997])) for both the encoder and the decoder, essentially forming a sequence autoencoder with the Gaussian prior acting as a regularizer on the hidden code. The decoder serves as a special rnn language model that is conditioned on this hidden code, and in the degenerate setting where the hidden code incorporates no useful information, this model is effectively equivalent to an rnnlm. The model is depicted in Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 3 A VAE for sentences ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"), and is used in all of the experiments discussed below.\n\nWe explored several variations on this architecture, including concatenating the sampled z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} to the decoder input at every time step, using a softplus parametrization for the variance, and using deep feedforward networks between the encoder and latent variable and the decoder and latent variable. We noticed little difference in the model’s performance when using any of these variations. However, when including feedforward networks between the encoder and decoder we found that it is necessary to use highway network layers (Srivastava et al., [2015])) for the model to learn. We discuss hyperparameter tuning in the appendix.\n\nWe also experimented with more sophisticated recognition models q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x), including a multistep sampling model styled after draw(Gregor et al., [2015])), and a posterior approximation using normalizing flows (Rezende and Mohamed, [2015])). However, we were unable to reap significant gains over our plain vae.\n\nWhile the strongest results with vaes to date have been on continuous domains like images, there has been some work on discrete sequences: a technique for doing this using rnn encoders and decoders, which shares the same high-level architecture as our model, was proposed under the name Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (vrae) for the modeling of music in Fabius and van Amersfoort ( [2014])). While there has been other work on including continuous latent variables in rnn-style models for modeling speech, handwriting, and music (Bayer and Osendorfer, [2015]); Chung et al., [2015])), these models include separate latent variables per timestep and are unsuitable for our goal of modeling global features.\n\nIn a recent paper with goals similar to ours, Miao et al. ( [2015])) introduce an effective VAE-based document-level language model that models texts as bags of words, rather than as sequences. They mention briefly that they have to train the encoder and decoder portions of the network in alternation rather than simultaneously, possibly as a way of addressing some of the issues that we discuss in Section [3.1]Optimization challenges ‣ 3 A VAE for sentences ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\").\n\n### 3.1 Optimization challenges\n\nOur model aims to learn global latent representations of sentence content.\nWe can quantify the degree to which our model learns global features by looking at the variational lower bound objective ( [1]In 2.2 The variational autoencoder ‣ 2 Background ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\")). The bound breaks into two terms: the data likelihood under the posterior (expressed as cross entropy), and the kl divergence of the posterior from the prior. A model that encodes useful information in the latent variable z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} will have a non-zero kl divergence term and a relatively small cross entropy term. Straightforward implementations of our vae fail to learn this behavior: except in vanishingly rare cases, most training runs with most hyperparameters yield models that consistently set q​(z→\\|x)𝑞conditional→𝑧𝑥q(\\\\vec{z}\\|x) equal to the prior p​(z→)𝑝→𝑧p(\\\\vec{z}), bringing the kl divergence term of the cost function to zero.\n\nWhen the model does this, it is essentially behaving as an rnnlm. Because of this, it can express arbitrary distributions over the output sentences (albeit with a potentially awkward left-to-right factorization) and can thereby achieve likelihoods that are close to optimal. Previous work on vaes for image modeling (Kingma and Welling, [2015])) used a much weaker independent pixel decoder model p​(x\\|z→)𝑝conditional𝑥→𝑧p(x\\|\\\\vec{z}), forcing the model to use the global latent variable to achieve good likelihoods. In a related result, recent approaches to image generation that use lstm decoders are able to do well without vae-style global latent variables (Theis and Bethge, [2015])).\n\nThis problematic tendency in learning is compounded by the lstm decoder’s sensitivity to subtle variation in the hidden states, such as that introduced by the posterior sampling process. This causes the model to initially learn to ignore z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} and go after low hanging fruit, explaining the data with the more easily optimized decoder. Once this has happened, the decoder ignores the encoder and little to no gradient signal passes between the two, yielding an undesirable stable equilibrium with the kl cost term at zero. We propose two techniques to mitigate this issue.\n\n#### KL cost annealing\n\nIn this simple approach to this problem, we add a variable weight to the kl term in the cost function at training time. At the start of training, we set that weight to zero, so that the model learns to encode as much information in z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} as it can. Then, as training progresses, we gradually increase this weight, forcing the model to smooth out its encodings and pack them into the prior. We increase this weight until it reaches 1, at which point the weighted cost function is equivalent to the true variational lower bound. In this setting, we do not optimize the proper lower bound on the training data likelihood during the early stages of training, but we nonetheless see improvements on the value of that bound at convergence. This can be thought of as annealing from a vanilla autoencoder to a vae. The rate of this increase is tuned as a hyperparameter.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: The weight of the kl divergence term of variational lower bound according to a typical sigmoid annealing schedule plotted alongside the (unweighted) value of the kl divergence term for our vae on the Penn Treebank.\n\nFigure [2]Figure 2 ‣ KL cost annealing ‣ 3.1 Optimization challenges ‣ 3 A VAE for sentences ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\") shows the behavior of the kl cost term during the first 50k steps of training on Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., [1993])) language modeling with kl cost annealing in place. This example reflects a pattern that we observed often: kl spikes early in training while the model can encode information in z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} cheaply, then drops substantially once it begins paying the full kl divergence penalty, and finally slowly rises again before converging as the model learns to condense more information into z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z}.\n\n#### Word dropout and historyless decoding\n\nIn addition to weakening the penalty term on the encodings, we also experiment with weakening the decoder.\nAs in rnnlms and sequence autoencoders, during learning our decoder predicts each word conditioned on the ground-truth previous word. A natural way to weaken the decoder is to remove some or all of this conditioning information during learning. We do this by randomly replacing some fraction of the conditioned-on word tokens with the generic unknown word token _unk_. This forces the model to rely on the latent variable z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} to make good predictions. This technique is a variant of word dropout (Iyyer et al., [2015]); Kumar et al., [2015])), applied not to a feature extractor but to a decoder. We also experimented with standard dropout (Srivastava et al., [2014])) applied to the input word embeddings in the decoder, but this did not help the model learn to use the latent variable.\n\nThis technique is parameterized by a keep rate k∈\\[0,1\\]𝑘01k\\\\in\\[0,1\\]. We tune this parameter both for our vae and for our baseline rnnlm. Taken to the extreme of k=0𝑘0k=0, the decoder sees no input, and is thus able to condition only on the number of words produced so far, yielding a model that is extremely limited in the kinds of distributions it can model without using z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z}.\n\n| Model | Standard | Inputless Decoder |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Train nll | Train ppl | Test nll | Test ppl | Train nll | Train ppl | Test nll | Test ppl |\n| RNNLM | 100 | – | 95 | 100 | – | 116 | 135 | – | 600 | 135 | – | >600absent600>600 |\n| VAE | 98 | (2) | 100 | 101 | (2) | 119 | 120 | (15) | 300 | 125 | (15) | 380 |\n\nTable 2:\n\nPenn Treebank language modeling results, reported as negative log likelihoods and as perplexities.

            "content": "In this section, we report on language modeling experiments on the Penn Treebank in an effort to discover whether the inclusion of a global latent variable is helpful for this standard task. For this reason, we restrict our vae hyperparameter search to those models which encode a non-trivial amount in the latent variable, as measured by the kl divergence term of the variational lower bound.\n\n#### Results\n\nWe used the standard train–test split for the corpus, and report test set results in Table [2]Table 2 ‣ Word dropout and historyless decoding ‣ 3.1 Optimization challenges ‣ 3 A VAE for sentences ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"). The results shown reflect the training and test set performance of each model at the training step at which the model performs best on the development set. Our reported figures for the vae reflect the variational lower bound on the test likelihood, while for the rnnlms, which can be evaluated exactly, we report the true test likelihood. This discrepancy puts the vae at a potential disadvantage.\n\nIn the standard setting, the vae performs slightly worse than the rnnlm baseline, though it does succeed in using the latent space to a limited extent: it has a reconstruction cost (99) better than that of the baseline rnnlm, but makes up for this with a kl divergence cost of 2. Training a vae in the standard setting without both word dropout and cost annealing reliably results in models with equivalent performance to the baseline rnnlm, and zero kl divergence.\n\nTo demonstrate the ability of the latent variable to encode the full content of sentences in addition to more abstract global features, we also provide numbers for an inputless decoder that does not condition on previous tokens, corresponding to a word dropout keep rate of 00. In this regime we can see that the variational lower bound contains a significantly larger kl term and shows a substantial improvement over the weakened rnnlm, which is essentially limited to using unigram statistics in this setting.\nWhile it is weaker than a standard decoder, the inputless decoder has the interesting property that its sentence generating process is fully differentiable. Advances in generative models of this kind could be promising as a means of generating text while using adversarial training methods, which require differentiable generators.\n\nEven with the techniques described in the previous section, including the inputless decoder, we were unable to train models for which the kl divergence term of the cost function dominates the reconstruction term. This suggests that it is still substantially easier to learn to factor the data distribution using simple local statistics, as in the rnnlm, such that an encoder will only learn to encode information in z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} when that information cannot be effectively described by these local statistics.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| but now , as they parked out front and owen stepped out of the car , he could see |\n| True:that the transition was complete . | RNNLM:it , ” i said . | VAE:through the driver ’s door . |\n| you kill him and his |\n| True:men . | RNNLM:. ” | VAE:brother . |\n| not surprising , the mothers dont exactly see eye to eye with me |\n| True:on this matter . | RNNLM:, i said . | VAE:, right now . |\n\nTable 3:\n\nExamples of using beam search to impute missing words within sentences.

            "content": "We claim that the our vae’s global sentence features make it especially well suited to the task of imputing missing words in otherwise known sentences. In this section, we present a technique for imputation and a novel evaluation strategy inspired by adversarial training. Qualitatively, we find that the vae yields more diverse and plausible imputations for the same amount of computation (see the examples given in Table [3]Table 3 ‣ Results ‣ 4 Results: Language modeling ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\")), but precise quantitative evaluation requires intractable likelihood computations. We sidestep this by introducing a novel evaluation strategy.\n\nWhile the standard rnnlm is a powerful generative model, the sequential nature of likelihood computation and decoding makes it unsuitable for performing inference over unknown words given some known words (the task of _imputation_).\nExcept in the special case where the unknown words all appear at the end of the decoding sequence, sampling from the posterior over the missing variables is intractable for all but the smallest vocabularies.\nFor a vocabulary of size V𝑉V, it requires O​(V)𝑂𝑉O(V) runs of full rnn inference per step of Gibbs sampling or iterated conditional modes.\nWorse, because of the directional nature of the graphical model given by an rnnlm, many steps of sampling could be required to propagate information between unknown variables and the known downstream variables.\nThe vae, while it suffers from the same intractability problems when sampling or computing map imputations, can more easily propagate information between all variables, by virtue of having a global latent variable and a tractable recognition model.\n\nFor this experiment and subsequent analysis, we train our models on the Books Corpus introduced in Kiros et al. ( [2015])).\nThis is a collection of text from 12k e-books, mostly fiction.\nThe dataset, after pruning, contains approximately 80m sentences. We find that this much larger amount of data produces more subjectively interesting generative models than smaller standard language modeling datasets. We use a fixed word dropout rate of 75% when training this model and all subsequent models unless otherwise specified. Our models (the vae and rnnlm) are trained as language models, decoding right-to-left to shorten the dependencies during learning for the vae. We use 512 hidden units.\n\n#### Inference method\n\nTo generate imputations from the two models, we use beam search with beam size 15 for the rnnlm and approximate iterated conditional modes (Besag, [1986])) with 3 steps of a beam size 5 search for the vae. This allows us to compare the same amount of computation for both models. We find that breaking decoding for the vae into several sequential steps is necessary to propagate information among the variables.\nIterated conditional modes is a technique for finding the maximum joint assignment of a set of variables by alternately maximizing conditional distributions, and is a generalization of “hard-em” algorithms like k-means (Kearns et al., [1998])).\nFor approximate iterated conditional modes, we first initialize the unknown words to the _unk_ token.\nWe then alternate assigning the latent variable to its mode from the recognition model, and performing constrained beam search to assign the unknown words.\nBoth of our generative models are trained to decode sentences from right-to-left, which shortens the dependencies involved in learning for the vae, and we impute the final 20% of each sentence. This lets us demonstrate the advantages of the global latent variable in the regime where the rnnlm suffers the most from its inductive bias.\n\n#### Adversarial evaluation\n\nDrawing inspiration from adversarial training methods for generative models as well as non-parametric two-sample tests (Goodfellow et al., [2014]); Li et al., [2015b]); Denton et al., [2015]); Gretton et al., [2012])), we evaluate the imputed sentence completions by examining their distinguishability from the true sentence endings.\nWhile the non-differentiability of the discrete rnn decoder prevents us from easily applying the adversarial criterion at train time, we can define a very flexible test time evaluation by training a discriminant function to separate the generated and true sentences, which defines an _adversarial error_.\n\nWe train two classifiers: a bag-of-unigrams logistic regression classifier and an lstm logistic regression classifier that reads the input sentence and produces a binary prediction after seeing the final _eos_ token.\nWe train these classifiers using early stopping on a 80/10/1080101080/10/10 train/dev/test split of 320k sentences, constructing a dataset of 50% complete sentences from the corpus (positive examples) and 50% sentences with imputed completions (negative examples). We define the _adversarial error_ as the gap between the ideal accuracy of the discriminator (50%, i.e. indistinguishable samples), and the actual accuracy attained.\n\n| Model | Adv. Err.

Unigram and lstm numbers are the _adversarial error_ (see text) and rnnlm numbers are the negative log-likelihood given to entire generated sentence by the rnnlm, a measure of sentence typicality. Lower is better on both metrics. The vae is able to generate imputations that are significantly more difficult to distinguish from the true sentences.\n\n#### Results\n\nAs a consequence of this experimental setup, the rnnlm cannot choose anything outside of the top 15 tokens given by the rnn’s initial unconditional distribution P​(x1\\|Null)𝑃conditionalsubscript𝑥1NullP(x\\_{1}\\|\\\\text{Null}) when producing the final token of the sentence, since it has not yet generated anything to condition on, and has a beam size of 15.\nTable [4]Table 4 ‣ Adversarial evaluation ‣ 5 Results: Imputing missing words ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\") shows that this weakness makes the rnnlm produce far less diverse samples than the vae and suffer accordingly versus the adversarial classifier.\nAdditionally, we include the score given to the entire sentence with the imputed completion given a separate independently trained language model.\nThe likelihood results are comparable, though the rnnlms favoring of generic high-probability endings such as “he said,” gives it a slightly lower negative log-likelihood.\nMeasuring the rnnlm likelihood of sentences themselves produced by an rnnlm is not a good measure of the power of the model, but demonstrates that the rnnlm can produce what it sees as high-quality imputations by favoring typical local statistics, even though their repetitive nature produces easy failure modes for the adversarial classifier.\nAccordingly, under the adversarial evaluation our model substantially outperforms the baseline since it is able to efficiently propagate information bidirectionally through the latent variable.\n\n| 100% word keep | 75% word keep |\n| --- | --- |\n| “ no , ” he said . | “ love you , too . ” |\n| “ thank you , ” he said . | she put her hand on his shoulder and followed him to the door . |\n| 50% word keep | 0% word keep |\n| “ maybe two or two . ” | i i hear some of of of |\n| she laughed again , once again , once again , and thought about it for a moment in long silence . | i was noticed that she was holding the in in of the the in |\n\nTable 5:\n\nSamples from a model trained with varying amounts of word dropout.

In the appendix, we provide some results on small text classification tasks.\n\n### 6.1 Analyzing the impact of word dropout\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: The values of the two terms of the cost function as word dropout increases.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| input | we looked out at the setting sun . | i went to the kitchen . | how are you doing ? |\n| mean | they were laughing at the same time . | i went to the kitchen . | what are you doing ? |\n| samp. 1 | ill see you in the early morning . | i went to my apartment . | “ are you sure ? |\n| samp. 2 | i looked up at the blue sky . | i looked around the room . | what are you doing ? |\n| samp. 3 | it was down on the dance floor . | i turned back to the table . | what are you doing ? |\n\nTable 7:\n\nThree sentences which were used as inputs to the vae, presented with greedy decodes from the mean of the posterior distribution, and from three samples from that distribution.\n\nFor this experiment, we train on the Books Corpus and test on a held out 10k sentence test set from that corpus. We find that train and test set performance are very similar. In Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 6.1 Analyzing the impact of word dropout ‣ 6 Analyzing variational models ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"), we examine the impact of word dropout on the variational lower bound, broken down into kl divergence and cross entropy components. We drop out words with the specified keep rate at training time, but supply all words as inputs at test time except in the 0%percent00\\\\% setting.\n\nWe do not re-tune the hyperparameters for each run, which results in the model with no dropout encoding very little information in z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} (i.e., the kl component is small).\nWe can see that as we lower the keep rate for word dropout, the amount of information stored in the latent variable increases, and the overall likelihood of the model degrades somewhat. Results from the Section [4]Results: Language modeling ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\") indicate that a model with no latent variable would degrade in performance significantly more in the presence of heavy word dropout.\n\nWe also qualitatively evaluate samples, to demonstrate that the increased kl allows meaningful sentences to be generated purely from continuous sampling. Since our decoder model p​(x\\|z→)𝑝conditional𝑥→𝑧p(x\\|\\\\vec{z}) is a sophisticated rnnlm, simply sampling from the directed graphical model (first p​(z→)𝑝→𝑧p(\\\\vec{z}) then p​(x\\|z→)𝑝conditional𝑥→𝑧p(x\\|\\\\vec{z})) would not tell us about how much of the data is being explained by the learned vector vs. the language model.\nInstead, for this part of the qualitative evaluation, we sample from the Gaussian prior, but use a greedy deterministic decoder for x𝑥x, taking each token xt=argmaxxt​p​(xt\\|x0,…,t−1,z→)subscript𝑥𝑡subscriptargmaxsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑥0…𝑡1→𝑧x\\_{t}=\\\\text{argmax}\\_{x\\_{t}}p(x\\_{t}\\|x\\_{0,...,t-1},\\\\vec{z}). This allows us to get a sense of how much of the variance in the data distribution is being captured by the distributed vector z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} as opposed to by local language model dependencies.\n\nThese results, shown in Table [5]Table 5 ‣ Results ‣ 5 Results: Imputing missing words ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"), qualitatively demonstrate that large amounts of variation in generated language can be achieved by following this procedure. At the low end, where very little of the variance is explained by z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z}, we see that greedy decoding applied to a Gaussian sample does not produce diverse sentences. As we increase the amount of word dropout and force z→→𝑧\\\\vec{z} to encode more information, we see the sentences become more varied, but past a certain point they begin to repeat words or show other signs of ungrammaticality.\nEven in the case of a fully dropped-out decoder, the model is able to capture higher-order statistics not present in the unigram distribution.\n\nAdditionally, in Table [6]Table 6 ‣ Results ‣ 5 Results: Imputing missing words ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\") we examine the effect of using lower-probability samples from the latent Gaussian space for a model with a 75% word keep rate.\nWe find lower-probability samples by applying an approximately volume-preserving transformation to the Gaussian samples that stretches some eigenspaces by up to a factor of 4.\nThis has the effect of creating samples that are not too improbable under the prior, but still reach into the tails of the distribution.\nWe use a random linear transformation, with matrix elements drawn from a uniform distribution from \\[−c,c\\]𝑐𝑐\\[-c,c\\], with c𝑐c chosen to give the desired properties (0.10.10.1 in our experiments).\nHere we see that the sentences are far less typical, but for the most part are grammatical and maintain a clear topic, indicating that the latent variable is capturing a rich variety of global features even for rare sentences.\n\n### 6.2 Sampling from the posterior\n\nIn addition to generating unconditional samples, we can also examine the sentences decoded from the posterior vectors p​(z\\|x)𝑝conditional𝑧𝑥p(z\\|x) for various sentences x𝑥x.\nBecause the model is regularized to produce distributions rather than deterministic codes, it does not exactly memorize and round-trip the input.\nInstead, we can see what the model considers to be similar sentences by examining the posterior samples in Table [7]Table 7 ‣ 6.1 Analyzing the impact of word dropout ‣ 6 Analyzing variational models ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\").\nThe codes appear to capture information about the number of tokens and parts of speech for each token, as well as topic information.\nAs the sentences get longer, the fidelity of the round-tripped sentences decreases.\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| “ i want to talk to you . ” |\n| “i want to be with you . ” |\n| “i do n’t want to be with you . ” |\n| i do n’t want to be with you . |\n| she did n’t want to be with him . |\n| he was silent for a long moment . |\n| he was silent for a moment . |\n| it was quiet for a moment . |\n| it was dark and cold . |\n| there was a pause . |\n| it was my turn . |\n\nTable 8:\n\nPaths between pairs of random points in vae space: Note that intermediate sentences are grammatical, and that topic and syntactic structure are usually locally consistent.\n\n### 6.3 Homotopies\n\nThe use of a variational autoencoder allows us to generate sentences using greedy decoding on continuous samples from the space of codes.\nAdditionally, the volume-filling and smooth nature of the code space allows us to examine for the first time a concept of _homotopy_ (linear interpolation) between sentences.\nIn this context, a homotopy between two codes z→1subscript→𝑧1\\\\vec{z}\\_{1} and z→2subscript→𝑧2\\\\vec{z}\\_{2} is the set of points on the line between them, inclusive, z→​(t)=z→1∗(1−t)+z→2∗t→𝑧𝑡subscript→𝑧11𝑡subscript→𝑧2𝑡\\\\vec{z}(t)=\\\\vec{z}\\_{1}\\*(1-t)+\\\\vec{z}\\_{2}\\*t for t∈\\[0,1\\]𝑡01t\\\\in\\[0,1\\].\nSimilarly, the homotopy between two sentences decoded (greedily) from codes z→1subscript→𝑧1\\\\vec{z}\\_{1} and z→2subscript→𝑧2\\\\vec{z}\\_{2} is the set of sentences decoded from the codes on the line.\nExamining these homotopies allows us to get a sense of what neighborhoods in code space look like – how the autoencoder organizes information and what it regards as a continuous deformation between two sentences.\n\nWhile a standard non-variational rnnlm does not have a way to perform these homotopies, a vanilla sequence autoencoder can do so. As mentioned earlier in the paper, if we examine the homotopies created by the sequence autoencoder in Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\"), though, we can see that the transition between sentences is sharp, and results in ungrammatical intermediate sentences.\nThis gives evidence for our intuition that the vae learns representations that are smooth and “fill up” the space.\n\nIn Table [8]Table 8 ‣ 6.2 Sampling from the posterior ‣ 6 Analyzing variational models ‣ Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space\") (and in additional tables in the appendix) we can see that the codes mostly contain syntactic information, such as the number of words and the parts of speech of tokens, and that all intermediate sentences are grammatical. Some topic information also remains consistent in neighborhoods along the path. Additionally, sentences with similar syntax and topic but flipped sentiment valence, e.g. “the pain was unbearable” vs. “the thought made me smile”, can have similar embeddings, a phenomenon which has been observed with single-word embeddings (for example the vectors for “bad” and “good” are often very similar due to their similar distributional characteristics).",

            "content": "A crucial feature of neural networks with a fixed network architecture is that they form a manifold by virtue of their continuously tunable weights, which underlies their ability to be trained by gradient descent. However, this conception of the space of neural networks is inadequate for understanding the computational processes the networks perform. For example, two neural networks trained to perform the same task may have vastly different weights, and yet implement the same high-level algorithms and computational processes (Maheswaranathan et al., [2019b])).\n\nIn this paper, we construct an algorithm which provides alternative parametrizations of the space of RNNs and CNNs with the goal of endowing a geometric structure that is more compatible with the high-level computational processes performed by neural networks. In particular, given a set of neural networks with the same or possibly different architectures (and possibly trained on different tasks), we find a parametrization of a low-dimensional submanifold of neural networks which approximately interpolates between these chosen “base models”, as well as extrapolates beyond them. We can use such model embedding spaces to cluster neural networks and even compute model averages of neural networks. A key feature is that two points in model embedding space are nearby if they correspond to neural networks which implement similar high-level computational processes, in a manner to be described later. In this way, two neural networks may correspond to nearby points in model embedding space even if those neural networks have distinct weights or even architectures.\n\nThe model embedding space is parametrized by a low-dimensional parameter θ∈ℝd𝜃superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and each base model is assigned a value of θ𝜃\\\\theta in the space. This allows us to apply traditional ideas from clustering and interpolation to the space of neural networks. Moreover, each model embedding space has an associated meta-model which, upon being given a θ𝜃\\\\theta, is rendered into an operable neural network. If a base model is mapped to some θ𝜃\\\\theta, then the meta-model, upon being given that θ𝜃\\\\theta, will emulate the corresponding base model. See Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\") for a diagrammatic depiction. An interesting application is that given two base models assigned to parameters θ1subscript𝜃1\\\\theta\\_{1} and θ2subscript𝜃2\\\\theta\\_{2}, we can consider the averaged model corresponding to the value (θ1+θ2)/2subscript𝜃1subscript𝜃22(\\\\theta\\_{1}+\\\\theta\\_{2})/2. We find that this averaged model performs similarly on the task for which the two base models were trained. We also use the model embedding space to extrapolate outside the space of base models, and find cases in which the model embedding manifold specifies models that perform better on a task than any trained base model. Later on we will explain how this can be regarded as a form of semi-supervised learning.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first provide the mathematical setup for our algorithmic construction of model embedding spaces. After reviewing related work, we then present results of numerical experiments which implement the algorithm and explore clustering, model averaging, and semi-supervised learning on the model embedding space. We further examine how topological features of the dynamics of RNNs in model embedding spaces are reflective of classes of high-level computational processes.

A sequence of inputs is notated as {xt}t=0Tsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑡0𝑇\\\\{x\\_{t}\\\\}\\_{t=0}^{T} which induces a sequence of hidden states by ht+1=F​(xt,ht)subscriptℎ𝑡1𝐹subscript𝑥𝑡subscriptℎ𝑡h\\_{t+1}=F(x\\_{t},h\\_{t}) where the initial hidden state h0subscriptℎ0h\\_{0} is given. A collection of sequences of inputs, possibly each with different maximum lengths T𝑇T, is denoted by 𝒟𝒟\\\\mathcal{D} which we call an input data set. We suppose that each base model RNN has an associated input data set.\n\n### 2.2 Meta-Models for RNNs\n\nGiven a collection base model RNNs, we would like to construct a meta-model which emulates the behavior of each of the base models. In this case, the meta-model is itself an RNN with one additional input θ∈ℝd𝜃superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} and a corresponding map F~​(θ,x,h)~𝐹𝜃𝑥ℎ\\\\widetilde{F}(\\\\theta,x,h) whose output is the next hidden state. Given a sequence of input states {xt}t=0Tsuperscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑡0𝑇\\\\{x\\_{t}\\\\}\\_{t=0}^{T} , we have a corresponding sequence of output states hθ,t+1=F~​(θ,xt,hθ,t)subscriptℎ𝜃𝑡1~𝐹𝜃subscript𝑥𝑡subscriptℎ𝜃𝑡h\\_{\\\\theta,t+1}=\\\\widetilde{F}(\\\\theta,x\\_{t},h\\_{\\\\theta,t}) starting from an initial hidden state h0subscriptℎ0h\\_{0} (which we suppose does not depend on θ𝜃\\\\theta). The meta-model also includes a hidden-to-output map G~​(h)~𝐺ℎ\\\\widetilde{G}(h) that is independent of θ𝜃\\\\theta.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Left: The hidden states htsubscriptℎ𝑡h\\_{t} of Fnsubscript𝐹𝑛F\\_{n} are close to the hidden states hθn,tsubscriptℎsubscript𝜃𝑛𝑡h\\_{\\\\theta\\_{n},t} of F~~𝐹\\\\widetilde{F} after the transformation map V𝑉V is applied.

We emphasize that θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\\\theta\\_{n} and Vnsubscript𝑉𝑛V\\_{n} depend on the particular base model under consideration. The first criterion means that at some particular θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\\\theta\\_{n} , the outputs of the meta-model RNN dynamics are close to the outputs of the base model RNN dynamics. The second criterion means that at the same θnsubscript𝜃𝑛\\\\theta\\_{n} , there is a time-independent transformation Vnsubscript𝑉𝑛V\\_{n} (i.e., Vnsubscript𝑉𝑛V\\_{n} does not depend on t𝑡t) such the transformed hidden state dynamics of the meta-model are close to the hidden state dynamics of the base model. See Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 2.2 Meta-Models for RNNs ‣ 2 Dynamical Model Embedding ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\") for a visualization. As depicted in the Figure, it is convenient to regard the meta-model RNN as having inputs (θn,x)subscript𝜃𝑛𝑥(\\\\theta\\_{n},x).

            "content": "There is a substantial body of work on interpreting the computational processes implemented by neural networks by studying their intermediate representations. Such analyses have been performed on individual models (Simonyan et al., [2013]); Zeiler and Fergus, [2014]); Lenc and Vedaldi, [2015])) and on collections of models (Li et al., [2016]); Raghu et al., [2017]); Morcos et al., [2018]); Kornblith et al., [2019])). Prior work in this latter category has focused on pairwise comparisons between models. For example, SVCCA (Raghu et al., [2017])) uses canonical correlation analysis to measure the representational similarity between pairs of models. While these methods can also be used to derive model representations by embedding the pairwise distance matrix, our approach does not require the Θ​(N2)Θsuperscript𝑁2\\\\Theta(N^{2}) computational cost of comparing all pairs of base models.\nMoreover, Dynamo yields an executable meta-model that can be run with model embedding vectors other than those corresponding to the base models.\n\nThere is a related body of work in the field of computational neuroscience. CCA-based techniques and representational geometry are standard for comparing neural networks to the neural activations of animals performing vision tasks (Yamins and DiCarlo, [2016])) as well as motor tasks. In an example of the latter, the authors of (Sussillo et al., [2015])) used CCA techniques to compare brain recordings to those of neural networks trained to reproduce the reaching behaviors of animals, while the authors of (Maheswaranathan et al., [2019b])) used fixed point analyses of RNNs to consider network similarity from a topological point of view.\n\nDynamo can be viewed as a form of knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., [2015])), since the outputs of the base models serve as targets in the optimization of the meta-model. However, unlike typical instances of knowledge distillation involving an ensemble of teacher networks (Hinton et al., [2015]); Fukuda et al., [2017])) where individual model predictions are averaged to provide more accurate target labels for the student, our approach instead aims to preserve the dynamics and outputs of each individual base model.\nFitNets (Romero et al., [2015])) employ a form a knowledge distillation using maps between hidden representations to guide learning; this is similar to our use of hidden state maps in training the meta-model.\n\nOur treatment of the model embedding vectors {θn}subscript𝜃𝑛\\\\{\\\\theta\\_{n}\\\\} as learnable parameters is similar to the approach used in Generative Latent Optimization (Bojanowski et al., [2018])), which jointly optimizes the image generator network and the latent vectors corresponding to each image in the training set. Bojanowski et al. ( [2018])) find that the principal components of the image representation space found by GLO are semantically meaningful. We likewise find that the principal components of the model embeddings found by Dynamo are discriminative between subsets of models.\n\nUnlike methods such as hypernetworks (Ha et al., [2017])) and LEO (Rusu et al., [2019])) that use a model to generate parameters for a separate network, our approach does not attempt to reproduce the parameters of the base models in the collection.\nInstead, the meta-model aims to reproduce only the hidden states and outputs of a base model when conditioned on the corresponding embedding vector.\n\nThe core focus of our work also differs from that of the meta-learning literature (Santoro et al., [2016]); Ravi and Larochelle, [2017]); Finn et al., [2017]); Munkhdalai and Yu, [2017])), which is primarily concerned with the problem of few-shot adaptation when one is presented with data from a new task. Our empirical study centers on the post-hoc analysis of a given collection of models, which may or may not have been trained on different tasks. However, we remark that our exploration of optimization in low-dimensional model embedding space is related to LEO (Rusu et al., [2019])), where a compressed model representation is leveraged for efficient meta-learning.",

In these plots, we observe a clear separation of these networks according to the size of the available training data, the RNN model architecture, and the specific NLP task used for training. By computing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix corresponding to the N𝑁N model embeddings, we obtain a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality of the corresponding collections of models. In Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Visualizing Model Similarity in Embedding Space ‣ 4 Empirical Results ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\"), we find that 2 to 6 components are sufficient to explain 95%percent9595\\\\% of the variance in the model embeddings.\n\nBy tuning the output loss hyperparameter λ𝜆\\\\lambda in equation [4]In 2.2 Meta-Models for RNNs ‣ 2 Dynamical Model Embedding ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\"), we can adjust the degree of emphasis placed on reproducing the hidden dynamics of the base networks versus their outputs. We demonstrate this effect in Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.1 Visualizing Model Similarity in Embedding Space ‣ 4 Empirical Results ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\"): with λ=1𝜆1\\\\lambda=1, we observe clear separation of ResNet-34 models trained on CIFAR-100 with different data augmentation policies (“weak”, with shifts and horizontal flips vs. “strong”, with RandAugment (Cubuk et al., [2020]))), and with different training set sizes. In contrast, with λ=0𝜆0\\\\lambda=0 we find a weak clustering effect corresponding to differing data augmentation, and we do not find a detectable separation corresponding to differing training set sizes. We infer that the change in data augmentation policy results in a larger difference in the learned feature representations than the change in training set size.\nIn Appendix [B]Appendix B Additional Experimental Details ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\") we illustrate the effect of setting λ=0𝜆0\\\\lambda=0 for RNN models.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: 2D multidimensional scaling (MDS) embeddings of the SVCCA pairwise representational distances between RNN models trained on the IMDB sentiment dataset.\n\nWe additionally compare the embeddings obtained using Dynamo to those derived from SVCCA (Raghu et al., [2017])), a pairwise comparison technique that aligns the representations produced by a pair of networks using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). In Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4.1 Visualizing Model Similarity in Embedding Space ‣ 4 Empirical Results ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\"), we plot the 2D embeddings obtained using multidimensional scaling (MDS) on the pairwise distance matrix computed using SVCCA (modified to output L2superscript𝐿2L^{2} distances instead of correlations). Unlike the principal components of the Dynamo model embeddings plotted in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Visualizing Model Similarity in Embedding Space ‣ 4 Empirical Results ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\"), the MDS coordinates are not semantically interpretable. Additionally, the cluster structure of the collection of GRUs trained with varying training set sizes is less apparent in this representation.\n\nLastly, we note that Dynamo allows for flexibility in defining the metric used to compare the hidden states and outputs of the base models with those of the meta-model.

First, the test accuracy varies smoothly when interpolating θ𝜃\\\\theta between pairs of base model embeddings—we would in general _not_ observe this property when interpolating the parameters of the base GRUs directly, since they were trained with different random initializations and orderings of the training examples. Second, we observe that the embedding vector that realizes the highest test accuracy lies _outside_ the convex hull of the base model embeddings. This is perhaps surprising since typical training and inference protocols involve the use of convex combinations of various objects: for instance, averaging of predictions in model ensembles and averaging of model parameters during training (e.g., using exponential moving averages or Stochastic Weight Averaging (Izmailov et al., [2018]))). This extrapolatory phenomenon suggests that Dynamo is able to derive a low-dimensional manifold of models that generalizes beyond the behavior of the base models used for training the meta-model.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 6: Meta-model test accuracies over model embedding space. We plot the relative test accuracies (normalized by the maximal test accuracy of the base models) realized by meta-models for GRUs trained on IMDB sentiment classification with varying training set size (left), and for GRUs trained on IMDB and on AG News classification (right). In these examples, the embedding vectors that maximize test accuracy (marked by ✕) do not correspond to any single base model, suggesting that meta-models are capable of generalizing beyond the base models used for training.\n\n### 4.3 Semi-Supervised Learning in Model Embedding Space\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 7: Semi-supervised learning with low-dimensional model embeddings. The red line shows the trajectory of 100 SGD iterates in model embedding space, starting from θinit=0subscript𝜃init0\\\\theta\\_{\\\\mathrm{init}}=0 and terminating at θfinalsubscript𝜃final\\\\theta\\_{\\\\mathrm{final}}. White and orange points indicate the base model embeddings.\n\nThe existence of model embeddings that improve on the accuracy of the base models suggests a natural semi-supervised learning (SSL) procedure involving a trained meta-model. In particular, we minimize the loss incurred by the meta-model on a small set of additional labeled examples by optimizing the value of θ𝜃\\\\theta.

            "content": "In this Section we perform an analysis of the dynamical features generated by the meta-models trained on base\nmodels that perform the sentiment classification task. Sentiment classification tasks have a well-understood dynamical structure (Sussillo and Barak, [2013]); Maheswaranathan et al., [2019a]), [b]); Aitken et al., [2020])) that we can use as a basis for understanding the behavior of a corresponding meta-model. To a first approximation, the sentiment analysis task can be solved by a simple integrator that accumulates sentiment corresponding to each word (positive words such as ‘good’ or ‘fantastic’ adding positive sentiment, and negative words such as ‘bad’ or ‘terrible’ adding negative sentiment). It has been shown that simple sentiment analysis models approximate this integrator by constructing a line attractor in the space of hidden states. For instance, for the zero input x∗=0→superscript𝑥→0x^{\\*}=\\\\vec{0}, it has been observed\nthat the dynamical system generated by the map Fx∗​(h)=F​(x∗,h)subscript𝐹superscript𝑥ℎ𝐹superscript𝑥ℎF\\_{x^{\\*}}(h)=F(x^{\\*},h) has a tubular region with very\nlittle movement, in the sense that ‖Fx∗​(h)−h‖2subscriptnormsubscript𝐹superscript𝑥ℎℎ2\\\\\\|F\\_{x^{\\*}}(h)-h\\\\\\|\\_{2} is very small for hidden states hℎh in this region.\n\nTo investigate the dynamical behavior of the meta-model space, we trained a meta-model on a set of\n20 base models which were themselves trained on the IMDB sentiment analysis task.

The θ𝜃\\\\theta points corresponding to these base models cluster in the model\nembedding space according to the amount of training data. In Figure [8]Figure 8 ‣ 5 Dynamics of Meta-Models for RNNs ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\") we perform a fixed-point\nanalysis of several models corresponding to points of interest in the model embedding space.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 8: Model embedding space as a space of line attractors.\nWe plot the model embeddings of 20 base models trained on the IMDB sentiment classification task (left), along with the centroids of each cluster (marked by ✕ and ✕). The green cluster corresponds to models trained on 100%percent100100\\\\% of the data and the blue cluster corresponds to models trained on a fixed 50%percent5050\\\\% fraction of the training data. A model having better\ntest accuracy than any trained base model is also plotted (marked by ✕). For several of the points of interest,\nwe (right) find the structure of a line attractor in the hidden state space by computing approximate fixed points of the\nmap h↦F​(x∗,h)maps-toℎ𝐹superscript𝑥ℎh\\\\mapsto F(x^{\\*},h). The line attractors are shown for the point marked by an ✕, the\ntwo centroids makred by ✕ and ✕, and two interpolated values in the model embedding space marked by ✕’s. We also chose one point from each cluster to compare with the centroid of each cluster; those chosen points are the top left green point and the bottom right blue point.\n\nThe fixed-point analysis was run according to the procedure described in (Golub and Sussillo, [2018])). First we selected a set of candidate hidden states hjsubscriptℎ𝑗h\\_{j} by running the model on a typical batch of inputs.

An interpretation of this result pertaining to topological conjugacy in dynamical systems theory is discussed in Appendix [C]Appendix C Meta-models and topological conjugacy ‣ Analyzing Populations of Neural Networks via Dynamical Model Embedding\").

In our experiments where the base models were trained on the sentiment analysis task, the model embedding space describes a space of line attractors which vary smoothly in the parameter θ𝜃\\\\theta.\n\nWe have demonstrated that Dynamo can be broadly applied to neural networks that have a dynamical structure; for example, we used the demarcation of layers of convolutional neural networks as a proxy for a dynamical time variable. This also suggests possible scientific applications of Dynamo to dynamical systems arising in nature. A present limitation of Dynamo is the need for all base models to have the same input structure. For example, one cannot presently utilize Dynamo to compare language models trained with different encodings (character-based vs. word-based, for example).\n\n#### Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Will Allen, Semon Rezchikov, and Krishna Shenoy for valuable discussions.

Motivated by this problem, we introduce\nDYNAMO, an algorithm that constructs low-dimensional manifolds where each point\ncorresponds to a neural network model, and two points are nearby if the\ncorresponding neural networks enact similar high-level computational processes.\nDYNAMO takes as input a collection of pre-trained neural networks and outputs a\nmeta-model that emulates the dynamics of the hidden states as well as the\noutputs of any model in the collection. The specific model to be emulated is\ndetermined by a model embedding vector that the meta-model takes as input;\nthese model embedding vectors constitute a manifold corresponding to the given\npopulation of models. We apply DYNAMO to both RNNs and CNNs, and find that the\nresulting model embedding spaces enable novel applications: clustering of\nneural networks on the basis of their high-level computational processes in a\nmanner that is less sensitive to reparameterization; model averaging of several\nneural networks trained on the same task to arrive at a new, operable neural\nnetwork with similar task performance; and semi-supervised learning via\noptimization on the model embedding space. Using a fixed-point analysis of\nmeta-models trained on populations of RNNs, we gain new insights into how\nsimilarities of the topology of RNN dynamics correspond to similarities of\ntheir high-level computational processes."

While engineering or physics problems often assume the dynamics of the system of interest are known to a high degree of accuracy, in an unsupervised setting, the dynamics of the system have to be learned from the observed data. The variational autoencoder (VAE) framework makes it possible to jointly learn the parameters of the state-space description and an inference network to amortize posterior computation of the unknown latent state (Kingma and Welling, [2014]); Karl et al., [2016]); Krishnan et al., [2016]); Pandarinath et al., [2018])). However, it can be challenging to structure the variational approximation and design an inference network that permit fast evaluation of the ELBO while preserving the temporal structure of the posterior.\n\nIn this work, we develop a structured variational approximation, approximate ELBO, and inference network architecture for generative models specified by nonlinear dynamical systems driven by Gaussian noise.

When the generative model, (𝜽,𝝍)𝜽𝝍(\\\\bm{\\\\theta},\\\\bm{\\\\psi}), is fixed, the statistical inference problem is to compute statistics of the smoothed posterior, p​(\\\\vz1:T∣\\\\vy1:T)𝑝conditionalsubscript\\\\vz:1𝑇subscript\\\\vy:1𝑇p(\\\\vz\\_{1:T}\\\\mid\\\\vy\\_{1:T}). If the generative model is not known, then the smoothing problem requires learning estimates of (𝜽,𝝍)𝜽𝝍(\\\\bm{\\\\theta},\\\\bm{\\\\psi}) from the data – known as system identification.\n\nVariational inference makes it possible to accomplish these goals in a harmonious way. The variational expectation maximization (vEM) algorithm would proceed by maximizing a lower bound to the log-marginal likelihood – the evidence lower bound (ELBO) – with respect to the parameters of an approximate posterior, q​(\\\\vz1:T)≈p​(\\\\vz1:T∣\\\\vy1:T)𝑞subscript\\\\vz:1𝑇𝑝conditionalsubscript\\\\vz:1𝑇subscript\\\\vy:1𝑇q(\\\\vz\\_{1:T})\\\\approx p(\\\\vz\\_{1:T}\\\\mid\\\\vy\\_{1:T}); then, with parameters of the variational approximation fixed, the ELBO is maximized with respect to the parameters of the generative model (Turner and Sahani, [2011])). For large scale problems, vEM may be slow as a result of having to fully optimize for the parameters of the approximate posterior before taking gradient steps on parameters of the generative model. For that reason, the variational autoencoding (VAE) may be better suited for large scale problems for its ability to simultaneous learn the parameters of the generative model and an inference network – an expressive parametric function mapping data to parameters of a posterior approximation (Kingma and Ba, [2014]); Rezende et al., [2014])).\n\nModel specifications.

The structured variational autoencoder (SVAE) (Johnson et al., [2016])) makes it possible to efficiently evaluate the ELBO while preserving the temporal structure of the posterior by restricting the prior to a linear dynamical system and then constructing the approximation as q​(\\\\vz1:T)∝p𝜽​(\\\\vz1:T)​∏exp⁡(t​(\\\\vzt)⊤​ψ​(\\\\vyt))proportional-to𝑞subscript\\\\vz:1𝑇subscript𝑝𝜽subscript\\\\vz:1𝑇product𝑡superscriptsubscript\\\\vz𝑡top𝜓subscript\\\\vy𝑡q(\\\\vz\\_{1:T})\\\\propto p\\_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}(\\\\vz\\_{1:T})\\\\prod\\\\exp(t(\\\\vz\\_{t})^{\\\\top}\\\\psi(\\\\vy\\_{t})) so that its statistics can be obtained using efficient message passing algorithms. However, the SVAE is not directly applicable when the dynamics are nonlinear since the joint prior will no longer be Gaussian (thereby not allowing for efficient conjugate updates). For an LDS, our approach contains the SVAE as a special case if the expected mean parameters, 𝔼qt−1​\\[𝝁𝜽​(\\\\vzt−1)\\]subscript𝔼subscript𝑞𝑡1delimited-\\[\\]subscript𝝁𝜽subscript\\\\vz𝑡1\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{t-1}}\\\\left\\[\\\\bm{\\\\mu}\\_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}(\\\\vz\\_{t-1})\\\\right\\], are found in closed form rather than sampled. Recently,  (Zhao and Linderman, [2023])) expand on the SVAE framework by exploiting the linear dynamical system structure and associative scan operations to enhance SVAE scalability.\n\nThe deep Kalman filter (dKF) introduced in  (Krishnan et al., [2016])) uses black-box inference networks to make drawing joint samples from the full posterior simple. However, pure black-box amortization networks such as those can make learning the parameters of the generative model dynamics difficult because their gradients will not propagate through the expected log-likelihood term (Karl et al., [2016])). In contrast, we consider inference networks inspired by the fundamental importance of the prior for evaluating exact Bayesian conjugate updates.\n\nThe deep variational Bayes filter (dVBF) also considers inference and learning in state-space graphical models (Karl et al., [2016])). Difficulties of learning the generative model that arise as a result of more standard VAE implementations defining inference networks independent of the prior are handled by forcing samples from the approximate posterior to traverse through the dynamics. Our work extends this concept, but in a different way by directly specifying the parameters of the variational approximation in terms of the prior.\n\nOur approach constructs an inference network infused with the prior similar to the SVAE and dVBF but i) avoids restrictions to linear dynamical systems and ii) affords easy access to approximations of the marginal statistics (such as the dense latent state covariances) without having to average over sampled trajectories (or store them directly which would be prohibitive as the latent dimensionality becomes large).",

Parameters output by inference networks will contribute additively to the precision-scaled mean and precision of the variational approximation. The precision scaled mean is unbounded, but, updates to the precision should be restricted to positive-semidefinite matrices. Therefore, we choose the following unconstrained low-rank parameterization by setting\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜶tsubscript𝜶𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t} | =(\\\\vat\\\\vAt​\\\\vAt⊤)≔(\\\\va​(\\\\vyt)\\\\vA​(\\\\vyt)​\\\\vA​(\\\\vyt)⊤)absentmatrixsubscript\\\\va𝑡subscript\\\\vA𝑡superscriptsubscript\\\\vA𝑡top≔matrix\\\\vasubscript\\\\vy𝑡\\\\vAsubscript\\\\vy𝑡\\\\vAsuperscriptsubscript\\\\vy𝑡top\\\\displaystyle=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\va\\_{t}\\\\\\<br>\\\\vA\\_{t}\\\\vA\\_{t}^{\\\\top}\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\coloneqq\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\va(\\\\vy\\_{t})\\\\\\<br>\\\\vA(\\\\vy\\_{t})\\\\vA(\\\\vy\\_{t})^{\\\\top}\\\\end{pmatrix} |  | (24) |\n\nwhere \\\\vAt∈ℝL×rαsubscript\\\\vA𝑡superscriptℝ𝐿subscript𝑟𝛼\\\\vA\\_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times r\\_{\\\\alpha}}. Now, we can take advantage of having defined separate local and backward encoders, to principally handle missing data by building the dependence of 𝜷t+1subscript𝜷𝑡1\\\\bm{\\\\beta}\\_{t+1} on \\\\vyt+1:Tsubscript\\\\vy:𝑡1𝑇\\\\vy\\_{t+1:T} through their local encodings, 𝜶t+1:Tsubscript𝜶:𝑡1𝑇\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t+1:T}. Similar to the local encoder, the backward encoder is parameterized as\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜷tsubscript𝜷𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\bm{\\\\beta}\\_{t} | =(\\\\vbt\\\\vBt​\\\\vBt⊤)≔(\\\\vb​(𝜶t:T)\\\\vB​(𝜶t:T)​\\\\vB​(𝜶t:T)⊤)absentmatrixsubscript\\\\vb𝑡subscript\\\\vB𝑡superscriptsubscript\\\\vB𝑡top≔matrix\\\\vbsubscript𝜶:𝑡𝑇\\\\vBsubscript𝜶:𝑡𝑇\\\\vBsuperscriptsubscript𝜶:𝑡𝑇top\\\\displaystyle=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\vb\\_{t}\\\\\\<br>\\\\vB\\_{t}\\\\vB\\_{t}^{\\\\top}\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\coloneqq\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\vb(\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t:T})\\\\\\<br>\\\\vB(\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t:T})\\\\vB(\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t:T})^{\\\\top}\\\\end{pmatrix} |  | (25) |\n\nwhere \\\\vBt∈ℝL×rβsubscript\\\\vB𝑡superscriptℝ𝐿subscript𝑟𝛽\\\\vB\\_{t}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{L\\\\times r\\_{\\\\beta}}.

In practice, this might be handled by a simple inference network such as,\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜶tsubscript𝜶𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t} | =NN​(\\\\vyt)absentNNsubscript\\\\vy𝑡\\\\displaystyle=\\\\text{NN}(\\\\vy\\_{t}) | 𝜷tsubscript𝜷𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\bm{\\\\beta}\\_{t} | =S2S​(\\[𝜷t+1,𝜶t\\])absentS2Ssubscript𝜷𝑡1subscript𝜶𝑡\\\\displaystyle=\\\\text{S2S}(\\[\\\\bm{\\\\beta}\\_{t+1},\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t}\\]) |  | (27) |\n\neffectively mapping \\\\vy1:T↦(𝜶1:T,𝜷1:T)maps-tosubscript\\\\vy:1𝑇subscript𝜶:1𝑇subscript𝜷:1𝑇\\\\vy\\_{1:T}\\\\mapsto(\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{1:T},\\\\bm{\\\\beta}\\_{1:T}). The case where \\\\vytsubscript\\\\vy𝑡\\\\vy\\_{t} is not observed is handled by setting 𝜶t=𝟎subscript𝜶𝑡0\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\_{t}=\\\\bm{0} as a result of having built the inference networks around the natural parameterization of the variational approximation. In addition to seamlessly handling missing data, segmenting the local and backward encoders potentially reduces the dimensionality of the domain of the backward encoder for L<N𝐿𝑁L<N.\n\nDesign of these inference networks still brings many questions and opens up a zoo of interesting possibilities. For example, the observations may not be directly tied to all of the latent variables; these unread latent variables can act as a soft regularizer – making it possible to capture higher dimensional dynamical phenomena without directly influencing the likelihood. In that case, we also face design decisions such as whether or not to update those unread variables directly from the data. While such design choices can increase the gap between the ELBO and log-marginal likelihood, the additional structure imposed has the potential to ameliorate the difficulty of learning a suitable generative model.\n\nWhile this makes it possible to draw samples, \\\\vz1:Tssuperscriptsubscript\\\\vz:1𝑇𝑠\\\\vz\\_{1:T}^{s}, evaluate the ELBO, and jointly train the generative model/inference networks – the ELBO can be further manipulated to arrive at an expression that does not require stochastic evaluations of the expected KL.\n\nThe filtering distribution under pseudo observations. How can we obtain differentiable approximations to the filtering distribution under the pseudo observations? A straightforward approach is to consider a single pass through the pseudo observations forward in time to produce a series of approximations to the filtering and predictive distributions by propagating approximate messages recursively as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | (i) | q¯t∣T=arg⁡min𝔻KL(𝔼qt−1∣T\\[p𝜽(\\\\vzt∣\\\\vzt−1)\\]\\|\\|q¯t∣T)\\\\displaystyle\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\bar{q}\\_{t\\\\mid T}=\\\\operatorname\\*{\\\\arg\\\\!\\\\min}\\\\,\\\\mathbb{D}\\_{\\\\text{KL}}\\\\!\\\\left({\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{t-1\\\\mid T}}\\\\left\\[p\\_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}(\\\\vz\\_{t}\\\\mid\\\\vz\\_{t-1})\\\\right\\]}\\\\middle\\\\lvert\\\\middle\\\\rvert\\\\,{\\\\bar{q}\\_{t\\\\mid T}}\\\\right) |  | (28) |\n|  |  | ⟹𝝁¯t∣T=𝔼qt−1∣T​\\[𝝁𝜽​(\\\\vzt−1)\\]subscript¯𝝁conditional𝑡𝑇subscript𝔼subscript𝑞𝑡conditional1𝑇delimited-\\[\\]subscript𝝁𝜽subscript\\\\vz𝑡1\\\\displaystyle\\\\implies\\\\quad\\\\bar{\\\\bm{\\\\mu}}\\_{t\\\\mid T}=\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q\\_{t-1\\\\mid T}}\\\\left\\[\\\\bm{\\\\mu}\\_{\\\\bm{\\\\theta}}(\\\\vz\\_{t-1})\\\\right\\] |  |\n|  | (ii) | qt∣T=arg⁡min𝔻KL(qt∣T\\|\\|p(\\\\vy~t∣\\\\vzt)q¯t∣T)\\\\displaystyle\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,q\\_{t\\\\mid T}=\\\\operatorname\\*{\\\\arg\\\\!\\\\min}\\\\,\\\\mathbb{D}\\_{\\\\text{KL}}\\\\!\\\\left({q\\_{t\\\\mid T}}\\\\middle\\\\lvert\\\\middle\\\\rvert\\\\,{p(\\\\tilde{\\\\vy}\\_{t}\\\\mid\\\\vz\\_{t})\\\\bar{q}\\_{t\\\\mid T}}\\\\right) |  | (29) |\n|  |  | ⟹𝝀t∣T=𝝀¯t∣T+𝝀~tsubscript𝝀conditional𝑡𝑇subscript¯𝝀conditional𝑡𝑇subscript~𝝀𝑡\\\\displaystyle\\\\implies\\\\quad\\\\bm{\\\\lambda}\\_{t\\\\mid T}=\\\\bar{\\\\bm{\\\\lambda}}\\_{t\\\\mid T}+\\\\tilde{\\\\bm{\\\\lambda}}\\_{t} |  |\n\nIn the case the dynamics were linear and Gaussian, step (i) can be performed exactly; when the dynamics are nonlinear, a Monte-Carlo sample approximation is necessary. However, owing to design of the inference networks, step (ii) can be carried out exactly.\n\nExploiting sample approximation structure. To determine parameters of q¯t∣Tsubscript¯𝑞conditional𝑡𝑇\\\\bar{q}\\_{t\\\\mid T} fulfilling (i), we can appeal to the moment matching property of the reverse KL, which has an analytic solution, and use a Monte-Carlo estimate.

With that conceptual realization, the approximate statistical smoothing problem was transformed into an approximate filtering problem with respect to the pseudo observations determined by the inference networks.

            "content": "Learning quickly is a hallmark of human intelligence, whether it involves recognizing objects from a few examples or quickly learning new skills\nafter just minutes of experience. Our artificial agents should be able to do the same, learning and adapting quickly from only a few examples, and continuing to adapt as more data becomes available. This kind of fast and flexible learning is challenging, since the agent must integrate its prior experience with a small amount of new information, while avoiding overfitting to the new data. Furthermore, the form of prior experience and new data will depend on the task. As such, for the greatest applicability, the mechanism for learning to learn (or meta-learning) should be general to the task and the form of computation required to complete the task.\n\nIn this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that is general and model-agnostic, in the sense that it can be directly applied to any learning problem and model that is trained with a gradient descent procedure. Our focus is on deep neural network models, but we illustrate how our approach can easily handle different architectures and different problem settings, including classification, regression, and policy gradient reinforcement learning, with minimal modification.\nIn meta-learning, the goal of the trained model is to quickly learn a new task from a small amount of new data, and the model is\ntrained by the meta-learner to be able to learn on a large number of different tasks.\nThe key idea underlying our method is to\ntrain the model’s initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated\nthrough one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of data from that new task.\nUnlike prior meta-learning methods that learn an update function or learning rule (Schmidhuber, [1987]); Bengio et al., [1992]); Andrychowicz et al., [2016]); Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])), our algorithm does not expand the number of learned parameters nor place constraints on the model architecture (e.g. by requiring a recurrent model (Santoro et al., [2016])) or a Siamese network (Koch, [2015]))), and it can be readily combined with fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent neural networks. It can also be used with a variety of loss functions, including differentiable supervised losses and non-differentiable reinforcement learning objectives.\n\nThe process of training a model’s parameters such that a few gradient steps, or even a single gradient step, can produce good results on a new task can be viewed from a feature learning standpoint as building an internal representation that is broadly suitable for many tasks. If the internal representation is suitable to many tasks, simply fine-tuning the parameters slightly (e.g. by primarily modifying the top layer weights in a feedforward model) can produce good results. In effect, our procedure optimizes for models that are easy and fast to fine-tune, allowing the adaptation to happen in the right space for fast learning. From a dynamical systems standpoint, our learning process can be viewed as maximizing the sensitivity of the loss functions of new tasks with respect to the parameters: when the sensitivity is high, small local changes to the parameters can lead to large improvements in the task loss.\n\nThe primary contribution of this work is a simple model- and task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning that trains a model’s parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to fast learning on a new task.\nWe demonstrate the algorithm on different model types, including fully connected and convolutional networks, and in several distinct domains, including few-shot regression, image classification, and reinforcement learning.\nOur evaluation shows that our meta-learning algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art one-shot learning methods designed specifically for supervised classification, while using fewer parameters, but that it can also be readily applied to regression and can accelerate reinforcement learning in the presence of task variability, substantially outperforming direct pretraining as initialization.",

In effect, the test error on sampled tasks 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i} serves as the training error of the meta-learning process.\nAt the end of meta-training, new tasks are sampled from p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}),\nand meta-performance is measured by the model’s performance after learning from K𝐾K samples.\nGenerally, tasks used for meta-testing are held out during meta-training.\n\n### 2.2 A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm\n\n![Refer to caption]θ𝜃\\\\theta∇ℒ1∇subscriptℒ1\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{1}∇ℒ2∇subscriptℒ2\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{2}∇ℒ3∇subscriptℒ3\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{3}θ1∗subscriptsuperscript𝜃1\\\\theta^{\\*}\\_{1}θ2∗subscriptsuperscript𝜃2\\\\theta^{\\*}\\_{2}θ3∗subscriptsuperscript𝜃3\\\\theta^{\\*}\\_{3}Figure 1:\nDiagram of our model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML), which optimizes for a representation θ𝜃\\\\theta that can quickly adapt to new tasks.\n\nIn contrast to prior work, which has sought to train recurrent neural networks that ingest entire datasets (Santoro et al., [2016]); Duan et al., [2016b])) or feature embeddings that can be combined with nonparametric methods at test time (Vinyals et al., [2016]); Koch, [2015])), we propose a method that can learn the parameters of any standard model via meta-learning in such a way as to prepare that model for fast adaptation. The intuition behind this approach is that some internal representations are more transferrable than others. For example, a neural network might learn internal features that are broadly applicable to all tasks in p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}), rather than a single individual task. How can we encourage the emergence of such general-purpose representations? We take an explicit approach to this problem: since the model will be fine-tuned using a gradient-based learning rule on a new task, we will aim to learn a model in such a way that this gradient-based learning rule can make rapid progress on new tasks drawn from p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}), without overfitting. In effect, we will aim to find model parameters that are _sensitive_ to changes in the task, such that small changes in the parameters will produce large improvements on the loss function of any task drawn from p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}), when altered in the direction of the gradient of that loss (see Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 2.2 A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm ‣ 2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\")). We make no assumption on the form of the model, other than to assume that it is parametrized by some parameter vector θ𝜃\\\\theta, and that the loss function is smooth enough in θ𝜃\\\\theta that we can use gradient-based learning techniques.\n\nFormally, we consider a model\nrepresented by a parametrized function fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta}\nwith parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta.\nWhen adapting to a new task 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}, the model’s parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta become θi′superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}.\nIn our method, the updated parameter vector θi′superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime} is computed using one or more gradient descent updates on task 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}.\nFor example, when using one gradient update,\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | θi′=θ−α​∇θℒ𝒯i​(fθ).superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′𝜃𝛼subscript∇𝜃subscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃\\\\vspace{-0.15cm}\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\theta-\\\\alpha\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}(f\\_{\\\\theta}). |  |\n\nThe step size α𝛼\\\\alpha may be fixed as a hyperparameter or meta-learned.\nFor simplicity of notation, we will consider one gradient update for the rest of this section, but using multiple gradient updates is a straightforward extension.\n\nThe model parameters are trained by optimizing for the performance of fθi′subscript𝑓superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′f\\_{\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}} with respect to θ𝜃\\\\theta across tasks sampled from p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}).\nMore concretely, the meta-objective is as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | minθ​∑𝒯i∼p​(𝒯)ℒ𝒯i​(fθi′)=∑𝒯i∼p​(𝒯)ℒ𝒯i​(fθ−α​∇θℒ𝒯i​(fθ))subscript𝜃subscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝒯𝑖𝑝𝒯subscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′subscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝒯𝑖𝑝𝒯subscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃𝛼subscript∇𝜃subscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓𝜃\\\\displaystyle\\\\vspace{-0.2cm}\\\\min\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\sum\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}\\\\sim p(\\\\mathcal{T})}\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}(f\\_{\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}})=\\\\sum\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}\\\\sim p(\\\\mathcal{T})}\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}(f\\_{\\\\theta-\\\\alpha\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}(f\\_{\\\\theta})}) |  |\n\nNote that the meta-optimization is performed over the model parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta, whereas the objective is computed using the updated model parameters θ′superscript𝜃′\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}.\nIn effect, our proposed method aims to optimize the model parameters such that one or a small number of gradient steps on a new task will produce maximally effective behavior on that task.\n\nThe meta-optimization across tasks is performed via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), such that the model parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta are updated as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | θ←θ−β​∇θ​∑𝒯i∼p​(𝒯)ℒ𝒯i​(fθi′)←𝜃𝜃𝛽subscript∇𝜃subscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝒯𝑖𝑝𝒯subscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′\\\\vspace{-0.2cm}\\\\theta\\\\leftarrow\\\\theta-\\\\beta\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\theta}\\\\sum\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}\\\\sim p(\\\\mathcal{T})}\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}(f\\_{\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}}) |  | (1) |\n\nwhere β𝛽\\\\beta is the meta step size.

The domains differ in the form of loss function and in how data is generated by the task and presented to the model, but the same basic adaptation mechanism can be applied in both cases.\n\n### 3.1 Supervised Regression and Classification\n\nFew-shot learning is well-studied in the domain of supervised tasks, where the goal is to learn a new function from only a few input/output pairs for that task, using prior data from similar tasks for meta-learning. For example, the goal might be to classify images of a Segway after seeing only one or a few examples of a Segway, with a model that has previously seen many other types of objects. Likewise, in few-shot regression, the goal is to predict the outputs of a continuous-valued function from only a few datapoints sampled from that function, after training on many functions with similar statistical properties.\n\nTo formalize the supervised regression and classification problems in the context of the meta-learning definitions in Section [2.1]Meta-Learning Problem Set-Up ‣ 2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\"), we can define the horizon\nH=1𝐻1H=1 and drop the timestep subscript on 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t}, since the model accepts a single input and produces a single output, rather than a sequence of inputs and outputs.

A new task might involve achieving a new goal or succeeding on a previously trained goal in a new environment. For example, an agent might learn to quickly figure out how to navigate mazes so that, when faced with a new maze, it can determine how to reliably reach the exit with only a few samples.\nIn this section, we will discuss how MAML can be applied to meta-learning for RL.\n\nEach RL task 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i} contains an initial state distribution qi​(𝐱1)subscript𝑞𝑖subscript𝐱1q\\_{i}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{1}) and a transition distribution qi​(𝐱t+1\\|𝐱t,𝐚t)subscript𝑞𝑖conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑡1subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐚𝑡q\\_{i}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t+1}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t},\\\\mathbf{a}\\_{t}), and the loss ℒ𝒯isubscriptℒsubscript𝒯𝑖\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}} corresponds to the (negative) reward function R𝑅R. The entire task is therefore a Markov decision process (MDP) with horizon H𝐻H, where the learner is allowed to query a limited number of sample trajectories for few-shot learning. Any aspect of the MDP may change across tasks in p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}).

One successful approach for few-shot classification is to learn to compare new examples in a learned metric space using e.g. Siamese networks (Koch, [2015])) or recurrence with attention mechanisms (Vinyals et al., [2016]); Shyam et al., [2017]); Snell et al., [2017])).\nThese approaches have generated some of the most successful results, but are difficult to directly extend to other problems, such as reinforcement learning. Our method, in contrast, is agnostic to the form of the model and to the particular learning task.\n\nAnother approach to meta-learning is to train memory-augmented models on many tasks, where\nthe recurrent learner is trained to adapt to new tasks as it is rolled out. Such networks have been applied to few-shot image recognition (Santoro et al., [2016]); Munkhdalai & Yu, [2017])) and learning “fast” reinforcement learning agents (Duan et al., [2016b]); Wang et al., [2016])).\nOur experiments show that our method outperforms the recurrent approach on few-shot classification. Furthermore, unlike these methods, our approach simply provides a good weight initialization and uses the same gradient descent update for both the learner and meta-update.\nAs a result, it is straightforward to finetune the learner for additional gradient steps.\n\nOur approach is also related to methods for initialization of deep networks. In computer vision, models pretrained on large-scale image classification have been shown to learn effective features for a range of problems (Donahue et al., [2014])). In contrast, our method explicitly optimizes the model for fast adaptability, allowing it to adapt to new tasks with only a few examples.\nOur method can also be viewed as explicitly maximizing sensitivity of new task losses to the model parameters.\nA number of prior works have explored sensitivity in deep networks, often in the context of initialization (Saxe et al., [2014]); Kirkpatrick et al., [2016])). Most of these works have considered good random initializations, though a number of papers have addressed data-dependent initializers (Krähenbühl et al., [2016]); Salimans & Kingma, [2016])), including learned initializations (Husken & Goerick, [2000]); Maclaurin et al., [2015])). In contrast, our method explicitly trains the parameters for sensitivity on a given task distribution, allowing for extremely efficient adaptation for problems such as K𝐾K-shot learning and rapid reinforcement learning in only one or a few gradient steps.",

(2) Can MAML be used for meta-learning in multiple different domains, including supervised regression, classification, and reinforcement learning? (3) Can a model learned with MAML continue to improve with additional gradient updates and/or examples?\n\nAll of the meta-learning problems that we consider require some amount of adaptation to new tasks at test-time. When possible, we compare our results to an oracle that receives the identity of the task (which is a problem-dependent representation) as an additional input, as an upper bound on the performance of the model. All of the experiments were performed using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., [2016])), which allows for automatic differentiation through the gradient update(s) during meta-learning. The code is available online111Code for the regression and supervised experiments is at [github.com/cbfinn/maml] and code for the RL experiments is at [github.com/cbfinn/maml\\_rl].\n\n### 5.1 Regression\n\nWe start with a simple regression problem that illustrates the basic principles of MAML. Each task involves regressing from the input to the output of a sine wave, where the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid are varied between tasks. Thus, p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}) is continuous, where the amplitude varies within \\[0.1,5.0\\]0.15.0\\[0.1,5.0\\] and the phase varies within \\[0,π\\]0𝜋\\[0,\\\\pi\\], and the input and output both have a dimensionality of 111. During training and testing, datapoints 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x} are sampled uniformly from \\[−5.0,5.0\\]5.05.0\\[-5.0,5.0\\]. The loss is the mean-squared error between the prediction f​(𝐱)𝑓𝐱f(\\\\mathbf{x}) and true value. The regressor is a neural network model with 222 hidden layers of size 404040 with ReLU nonlinearities. When training with MAML, we use one gradient update with K=10𝐾10K=10 examples with a fixed step size α=0.01𝛼0.01\\\\alpha=0.01, and use Adam as the meta-optimizer (Kingma & Ba, [2015])). The baselines are likewise trained with Adam. To evaluate performance, we fine-tune a single meta-learned model on varying numbers of K𝐾K examples, and compare performance to two baselines: (a) pretraining on all of the tasks, which entails training a network to regress to random sinusoid functions and then, at test-time, fine-tuning with gradient descent on the K𝐾K provided points, using an automatically tuned step size, and (b) an oracle which receives the true amplitude and phase as input. In Appendix [C]Appendix C Additional Comparisons ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\"), we show comparisons to additional multi-task and adaptation methods.\n\nWe evaluate performance by fine-tuning the model learned by MAML and the pretrained model on K={5,10,20}𝐾51020K=\\\\{5,10,20\\\\} datapoints. During fine-tuning, each gradient step is computed using the same K𝐾K datapoints. The qualitative results, shown in Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\") and further expanded on in Appendix [B]Appendix B Additional Sinusoid Results ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\") show that the learned model is able to quickly adapt with only 555 datapoints, shown as purple triangles, whereas the model that is pretrained using standard supervised learning on all tasks is unable to adequately adapt with so few datapoints without catastrophic overfitting. Crucially, when the K𝐾K datapoints are all in one half of the input range, the model trained with MAML can still infer the amplitude and phase in the other half of the range, demonstrating that the MAML trained model f𝑓f has learned to model the periodic nature of the sine wave. Furthermore, we observe both in the qualitative and quantitative results (Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\") and Appendix [B]Appendix B Additional Sinusoid Results ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\")) that the model learned with MAML continues to improve with additional gradient steps, despite being trained for maximal performance after one gradient step. This improvement suggests that MAML optimizes the parameters such that they lie in a region that is amenable to fast adaptation and is sensitive to loss functions from p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}), as discussed in Section [2.2]A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm ‣ 2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\"), rather than overfitting to parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta that only improve after one step.\n\n### 5.2 Classification\n\nTable 1: Few-shot classification on held-out Omniglot characters (top) and the MiniImagenet test set (bottom). MAML achieves results that are comparable to or outperform state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent models.

The ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm shows 95%percent9595\\\\% confidence intervals over tasks. Note that the Omniglot results may not be strictly comparable since the train/test splits used in the prior work were not available.

The Omniglot dataset consists of 20 instances of 1623 characters from 50 different alphabets. Each instance was drawn by a different person. The MiniImagenet dataset was proposed by Ravi & Larochelle ( [2017])), and involves 64 training classes, 12 validation classes, and 24 test classes. The Omniglot and MiniImagenet image recognition tasks are the most common recently used few-shot learning benchmarks (Vinyals et al., [2016]); Santoro et al., [2016]); Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])). We follow the experimental protocol proposed by Vinyals et al. ( [2016])), which involves fast learning of N𝑁N-way classification with 1 or 5 shots. The problem of N𝑁N-way classification is set up as follows: select N𝑁N unseen classes, provide the model with K𝐾K different instances of each of the N𝑁N classes, and evaluate the model’s ability to classify new instances within the N𝑁N classes. For Omniglot, we randomly select 120012001200 characters for training, irrespective of alphabet, and use the remaining for testing. The Omniglot dataset is augmented with rotations by multiples of 909090 degrees, as proposed by Santoro et al. ( [2016])).\n\nOur model follows the same architecture as the embedding function used by Vinyals et al. ( [2016])), which has 4 modules with a 3×3333\\\\times 3 convolutions and 646464 filters, followed by batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, [2015])), a ReLU nonlinearity, and 2×2222\\\\times 2 max-pooling. The Omniglot images are downsampled to 28×28282828\\\\times 28, so the dimensionality of the last hidden layer is 646464. As in the baseline classifier used by Vinyals et al. ( [2016])), the last layer is fed into a softmax. For Omniglot, we used strided convolutions instead of max-pooling. For MiniImagenet, we used 323232 filters per layer to reduce overfitting, as done by (Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])).\nIn order to also provide a fair comparison against memory-augmented neural networks (Santoro et al., [2016])) and to test the flexibility of MAML, we also provide results for a non-convolutional network. For this, we use a network with 444 hidden layers with sizes 256256256, 128128128, 646464, 646464, each including batch normalization and ReLU nonlinearities, followed by a linear layer and softmax. For all models, the loss function is the cross-entropy error between the predicted and true class. Additional hyperparameter details are included in Appendix [A.1]A.1 Classification ‣ Appendix A Additional Experiment Details ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\").\n\nWe present the results in Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 5.2 Classification ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\"). The convolutional model learned by MAML compares well to the state-of-the-art results on this task, narrowly outperforming the prior methods. Some of these existing methods, such as matching networks, Siamese networks, and memory models are designed with few-shot classification in mind, and are not readily applicable to domains such as reinforcement learning. Additionally, the model learned with MAML uses fewer overall parameters compared to matching networks and the meta-learner LSTM, since the algorithm does not introduce any additional parameters beyond the weights of the classifier itself. Compared to these prior methods, memory-augmented neural networks (Santoro et al., [2016])) specifically, and recurrent meta-learning models in general, represent a more broadly applicable class of methods that, like MAML, can be used for other tasks such as reinforcement learning (Duan et al., [2016b]); Wang et al., [2016])). However, as shown in the comparison, MAML significantly outperforms memory-augmented networks and the meta-learner LSTM on 5-way Omniglot and MiniImagenet classification, both in the 111-shot and 555-shot case.\n\nA significant computational expense in MAML comes from the use of second derivatives when backpropagating the meta-gradient through the gradient operator in the meta-objective (see Equation ( [1]In 2.2 A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm ‣ 2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\"))). On MiniImagenet, we show a comparison to a first-order approximation of MAML, where these second derivatives are omitted. Note that the resulting method still computes the meta-gradient at the post-update parameter values θi′superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}, which provides for effective meta-learning. Surprisingly however, the performance of this method is nearly the same as that obtained with full second derivatives, suggesting that most of the improvement in MAML comes from the gradients of the objective at the post-update parameter values, rather than the second order updates from differentiating through the gradient update. Past work has observed that ReLU neural networks are locally almost linear (Goodfellow et al., [2015])), which suggests that second derivatives may be close to zero in most cases, partially explaining the good performance of the first-order approximation. This approximation removes the need for computing Hessian-vector products in an additional backward pass, which we found led to roughly 33%percent3333\\\\% speed-up in network computation.\n\n### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning\n\n![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Top: quantitative results from 2D navigation task, Bottom: qualitative comparison between model learned with MAML and with fine-tuning from a pretrained network.\n\n![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Reinforcement learning results for the half-cheetah and ant locomotion tasks, with the tasks shown on the far right. Each gradient step requires additional samples from the environment, unlike the supervised learning tasks. The results show that MAML can adapt to new goal velocities and directions substantially faster than conventional pretraining or random initialization, achieving good performs in just two or three gradient steps. We exclude the goal velocity, random baseline curves, since the returns are much worse (<−200absent200<-200 for cheetah and <−25absent25<-25 for ant).\n\nTo evaluate MAML on reinforcement learning problems, we constructed several sets of tasks based off of the simulated continuous control environments in the rllab benchmark suite (Duan et al., [2016a])). We discuss the individual domains below. In all of the domains, the model trained by MAML is a neural network policy with two hidden layers of size 100100100, with ReLU nonlinearities. The gradient updates are computed using vanilla policy gradient (REINFORCE) (Williams, [1992])), and we use trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) as the meta-optimizer (Schulman et al., [2015])). In order to avoid computing third derivatives, we use finite differences to compute the Hessian-vector products for TRPO. For both learning and meta-learning updates, we use the standard linear feature baseline proposed by Duan et al. ( [2016a])), which is fitted separately at each iteration for each sampled task in the batch. We compare to three baseline models: (a) pretraining one policy on all of the tasks and then fine-tuning, (b) training a policy from randomly initialized weights, and (c) an oracle policy which receives the parameters of the task as input, which for the tasks below corresponds to a goal position, goal direction, or goal velocity for the agent. The baseline models of (a) and (b) are fine-tuned with gradient descent with a manually tuned step size. Videos of the learned policies can be viewed at [sites.google.com/view/maml]\n\n2D Navigation.\nIn our first meta-RL experiment, we study a set of tasks where a point agent must move to different goal positions in 2D, randomly chosen for each task within a unit square. The observation is the current 2D position, and actions correspond to velocity commands clipped to be in the range \\[−0.1,0.1\\]0.10.1\\[-0.1,0.1\\]. The reward is the negative squared distance to the goal, and episodes terminate when the agent is within 0.010.010.01 of the goal or at the horizon of H=100𝐻100H=100. The policy was trained with MAML to maximize performance after 111 policy gradient update using 202020 trajectories. Additional hyperparameter settings for this problem and the following RL problems are in Appendix [A.2]A.2 Reinforcement Learning ‣ Appendix A Additional Experiment Details ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\").\nIn our evaluation, we compare adaptation to a new task with up to 4 gradient updates, each with 404040 samples. The results in Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.3 Reinforcement Learning ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\") show the adaptation performance of models that are initialized with MAML, conventional pretraining on the same set of tasks, random initialization, and an oracle policy that receives the goal position as input. The results show that MAML can learn a model that adapts much more quickly in a single gradient update, and furthermore continues to improve with additional updates.\n\nLocomotion.\nTo study how well MAML can scale to more complex deep RL problems, we also study adaptation on high-dimensional locomotion tasks with the MuJoCo simulator  (Todorov et al., [2012])). The tasks require two simulated robots – a planar cheetah and a 3D quadruped (the “ant”) – to run in a particular direction or at a particular velocity. In the goal velocity experiments, the reward is the negative absolute value between the current velocity of the agent and a goal, which is chosen uniformly at random between 0.00.00.0 and 2.02.02.0 for the cheetah and between 0.00.00.0 and 3.03.03.0 for the ant. In the goal direction experiments, the reward is the magnitude of the velocity in either the forward or backward direction, chosen at random for each task in p​(𝒯)𝑝𝒯p(\\\\mathcal{T}). The horizon is H=200𝐻200H=200, with 202020 rollouts per gradient step for all problems except the ant forward/backward task, which used 404040 rollouts per step. The results in Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 5.3 Reinforcement Learning ‣ 5 Experimental Evaluation ‣ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\") show that MAML learns a model that can quickly adapt its velocity and direction with even just a single gradient update, and continues to improve with more gradient steps. The results also show that, on these challenging tasks, the MAML initialization substantially outperforms random initialization and pretraining. In fact, pretraining is in some cases worse than random initialization, a fact observed in prior RL work (Parisotto et al., [2016])).",

            "content": "Conditioning refers to the existence of multiple input signals. For example, in an autoregressive model, where the primary input is the current hidden state or the output of the previous time step, a conditioning signal can drive the process in the desired direction. When performing text to speech with WaveNets \\[ [46])\\], the autoregressive signal is concatenated to the conditioning signal arising from the language features. Other forms of conditioning are less intuitive. For example, in Style GANs \\[ [24])\\], conditioning takes place by changing the weights of the normalization layers according to the desired style.\n\nIn various settings, it is natural to treat the two inputs x𝑥x and I𝐼I of the target function y​(x,I)𝑦𝑥𝐼y(x,I) as nested, i.e., multiple inputs x𝑥x correspond to the ‘context’ of the same conditioning input I𝐼I. A natural modeling \\[ [8]), [39]), [36])\\] is to encode the latter by some embedding network e𝑒e and to concatenate it to x𝑥x when performing inference q​(x,e​(I))𝑞𝑥𝑒𝐼q(x,e(I)) with a primary network q𝑞q. A less intuitive solution, commonly referred to as a hypernetwork, uses a primary network g𝑔g whose weights are not directly learned. Instead, g𝑔g has a fixed architecture, and a second network f𝑓f generates its weights based on the conditioning input as θI=f​(I)subscript𝜃𝐼𝑓𝐼\\\\theta\\_{I}=f(I). The network g𝑔g, with the weights θIsubscript𝜃𝐼\\\\theta\\_{I} can then be applied to any input x𝑥x.\n\nHypernetworks hold state of the art results on numerous popular benchmarks \\[ [4]), [48]), [6]), [49]), [30])\\], especially due to their ability to adapt g𝑔g for different inputs I𝐼I. This allows the hypernetwork to model tasks effectively, even when using a low-capacity g𝑔g. This lack of capacity is offset by using very large networks f𝑓f. For instance, in \\[ [29])\\], a deep residual hypernetwork that is trained from scratch outperforms numerous embedding-based networks that rely on ResNets that were pre-trained on ImageNet.\n\nThe property of modularity means that through f𝑓f, the network g𝑔g is efficiently parameterized. Consider the case in which we fit individual functions gI′subscriptsuperscript𝑔′𝐼g^{\\\\prime}\\_{I} to model each function yI=y​(⋅,I)subscript𝑦𝐼𝑦⋅𝐼y\\_{I}=y(\\\\cdot,I) independently (for any fixed I𝐼I). To successfully fit any of these functions, gI′subscriptsuperscript𝑔′𝐼g^{\\\\prime}\\_{I} would require some degree of minimal complexity in the worst case. We say that modularity holds if the primary network g𝑔g whose weights are given by f​(I)𝑓𝐼f(I) has the same minimal complexity as required by gI′subscriptsuperscript𝑔′𝐼g^{\\\\prime}\\_{I} in the worst case.\n\nIn this paper, we seek to understand this phenomenon. For this purpose, we compare two alternatives: the standard embedding method and the hypernetwork. Since neural networks often have millions of weights while embedding vectors have a dimension that is seldom larger than a few thousand, it may seem that f𝑓f is much more complex than e𝑒e. However, in hypernetworks, often the output of f𝑓f is simply a linear projection of a much lower dimensional bottleneck \\[ [29])\\]. More importantly, it is often the case that the function g𝑔g can be small, and it is the adaptive nature (where g𝑔g changes according to I𝐼I) that enables the entire hypernetwork (f𝑓f and g𝑔g together) to be expressive.\n\nIn general, the formulation of hypernetworks covers embedding-based methods. This implies that hypernetworks are at least as good as the embedding-based method and motivates the study of whether hypernetworks have a clear and measurable advantage. Complexity analysis provides a coherent framework to compare the two alternatives. In this paper, we compare the minimal parameter complexity needed to obtain a certain error in each of the two alternatives.\n\nContributions  The central contributions of this paper are:\n(i) Thm.

(iv) To validate the theoretical observations, we conducted experiments on synthetic data as well as on self-supervised learning tasks.\n\nTo summarize, since Thm. [1]Theorem 1. ‣ 3 Degrees of Approximation ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\") shows the minimal complexity for approximating smooth target functions, and Thm. [4]Theorem 4. ‣ 4.1 Comparing the complexities of 𝓆 and ℊ ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\") demonstrates that this is attainable by a hypernetwork, we conclude that hypernetworks are modular. In contrast, embedding methods are not since, as Thms.

The Bayesian formulation of \\[ [26])\\] introduces variational inference that involves both the parameter generating network and a primary network. Hypernetworks are especially suited for meta-learning tasks, such as few-shot \\[ [4])\\] and continual learning tasks \\[ [48])\\], due to the knowledge sharing ability of the weights generating network. Predicting the weights instead of performing backpropagation can lead to efficient neural architecture search \\[ [6]), [49])\\], and hyperparameter selection \\[ [30])\\].\n\nMultiplicative interactions, such as gating, attention layers, hypernetworks, and dynamic convolutions, were shown to strictly extend standard neural networks \\[ [23])\\]. However, the current literature has no theoretical guarantees that support the claim that interactions have a clear advantage.\n\nIn this work, we take an approximation theory perspective of this problem. For this purpose, as a starting point, we study standard neural networks as function approximators. There were various attempts to understand the capabilities of neural networks as universal function approximators \\[ [9]), [22])\\].\nMultiple extensions of these results \\[ [38]), [31]), [18]), [28]), [42])\\] quantify tradeoffs between the number of trainable parameters, width and depth of the neural networks as universal approximators. In particular, \\[ [38])\\] suggested upper bounds on the size of the neural networks of order 𝒪​(ϵ−n/r)𝒪superscriptitalic-ϵ𝑛𝑟\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\epsilon^{-n/r}), where n𝑛n is the input dimension, r𝑟r is the order of smoothness of the target functions, and ϵ>0italic-ϵ0\\\\epsilon>0 is the approximation accuracy. In another contribution, \\[ [10])\\] prove a lower bound on the complexity of the class of approximators that matches the upper bound Ω​(ϵ−n/r)Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ𝑛𝑟\\\\Omega(\\\\epsilon^{-n/r}). However, their analysis assumes that the approximation is robust in some sense (see Sec. [3]Degrees of Approximation ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\") for details). In addition, they show that robustness holds when the class of approximators 𝒻={f​(⋅;θ)∣θ∈Θ𝒻}𝒻conditional-set𝑓⋅𝜃𝜃subscriptΘ𝒻\\\\mathscr{f}=\\\\{f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta)\\\\mid\\\\theta\\\\in\\\\Theta\\_{\\\\mathscr{f}}\\\\} satisfies a certain notion of bi-Lipschitzness. However, as a consequence of this condition, any two equivalent functions (i.e., f​(⋅;θ1)=f​(⋅;θ2)𝑓⋅subscript𝜃1𝑓⋅subscript𝜃2f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\_{1})=f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\_{2})) must share the same parameterizations (i.e., θ1=θ2subscript𝜃1subscript𝜃2\\\\theta\\_{1}=\\\\theta\\_{2}). Unfortunately, this condition is not met for neural networks, as one can compute the same function with neural networks of the same architecture with different parameterizations. In Sec. [3]Degrees of Approximation ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), we show that for certain activation functions and under reasonable conditions, there exists a robust approximator and, therefore, the lower bound of the complexity is Ω​(ϵ−n/r)Ωsuperscriptitalic-ϵ𝑛𝑟\\\\Omega(\\\\epsilon^{-n/r}). Since the existence of a continuous selector is also a cornerstone in the proofs of Thms. [2]Theorem 2. ‣ 4.1 Comparing the complexities of 𝓆 and ℊ ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\")- [5]Theorem 5. ‣ 4.2 Parameter Complexity of Meta-Networks ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), the analysis in \\[ [10])\\] is insufficient to prove these results (for example, see the proof sketch of Thm. [4]Theorem 4. ‣ 4.1 Comparing the complexities of 𝓆 and ℊ ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\") in Sec. [4.1]Comparing the complexities of 𝓆 and ℊ ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\")). In \\[ [33]), [34]), [35])\\] a similar lower bound is shown, but, only for shallow networks.\n\nIn an attempt to understand the benefits of locality in convolutional neural networks, \\[ [37])\\] shows that when the target function is a hierarchical function, it can be approximated by a hierarchic neural network of smaller complexity, compared to the worst-case complexity for approximating arbitrary functions. In our Thm. [5]Theorem 5. ‣ 4.2 Parameter Complexity of Meta-Networks ‣ 4 Expressivity of Hypernetworks ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), we take a similar approach. We show that under standard assumptions in meta-learning, the overall number of trainable parameters in a hypernetwork necessary to approximate the target function is smaller by orders of magnitude, compared to approximating arbitrary functions with neural networks and the embedding method in particular.",

We recall the N𝑁N-width framework of \\[ [10])\\] (see also \\[ [40])\\]). Let 𝒻𝒻\\\\mathscr{f} be a class of functions (not necessarily neural networks) and S:𝕐→ℝN:𝑆→𝕐superscriptℝ𝑁S:\\\\mathbb{Y}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{N} be a continuous mapping between a function y𝑦y and its approximation, where with N:=N𝒻assign𝑁subscript𝑁𝒻N:=N\\_{\\\\mathscr{f}}.

We experimented with the MNIST \\[ [27])\\] and CIFAR10 datasets \\[ [25])\\] on two self-supervised learning tasks: predicting image rotations, described below and image colorization (Sec. 1.3 in the appendix). For image rotation, the target functions are y​(x,I)𝑦𝑥𝐼y(x,I), where I𝐼I is a sample from the dataset and x𝑥x is a rotated version of it with a random angle α𝛼\\\\alpha, which is a self-supervised task \\[ [21]), [15]), [13]), [16])\\].

In contrast to the embedding method, the hypernetwork’s performance improves when increasing its depth. For additional experiments on studying the effect of the embedding dimension, see Sec. 1.2 in the appendix.

While our analysis points to the existence of modularity in hypernetworks, it does not mean that this modularity is achievable through SGD optimization. However, our experiments as well as the successful application of this technology in practice, specifically using a large f𝑓f and a small g𝑔g, indicate that this is indeed the case, and the optimization methods are likely to converge to modular solutions.",

The inputs of the networks are x′=(i1,i2)∥(i1k+i2,i2k+i1,i1k−i2,i2k−i1)k=09superscript𝑥′conditionalsubscript𝑖1subscript𝑖2subscriptsuperscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑖𝑘1subscript𝑖2subscriptsuperscript𝑖𝑘2subscript𝑖1subscriptsuperscript𝑖𝑘1subscript𝑖2subscriptsuperscript𝑖𝑘2subscript𝑖19𝑘0x^{\\\\prime}=(i\\_{1},i\\_{2})\\\\\\|(i^{k}\\_{1}+i\\_{2},i^{k}\\_{2}+i\\_{1},i^{k}\\_{1}-i\\_{2},i^{k}\\_{2}-i\\_{1})^{9}\\_{k=0} and a flattened version of the gray-scaled image I𝐼I of dimensions dx′=42subscript𝑑superscript𝑥′42d\\_{x^{\\\\prime}}=42 and dI=1024subscript𝑑𝐼1024d\\_{I}=1024. The functions f𝑓f and e𝑒e are fully connected neural networks of the same architecture with a varying number of layers k=2,…,7𝑘2…7k=2,\\\\dots,7. Their input dimension is dIsubscript𝑑𝐼d\\_{I}, each hidden layer is of dimension 100100100 and their output dimensions are 450450450. We took primary networks g𝑔g and q𝑞q to be fully connected neural networks with two layers din→10→3→subscript𝑑in10→3d\\_{\\\\textnormal{in}}\\\\to 10\\\\to 3 and ELU activations within their hidden layers. For the hypernetwork case, we have: din=42subscript𝑑in42d\\_{\\\\textnormal{in}}=42 and for the embedding method din=42+450=492subscript𝑑in42450492d\\_{\\\\textnormal{in}}=42+450=492, since the input of q𝑞q is a concatenation of x′superscript𝑥′x^{\\\\prime} (of dimension 424242) and e​(I)𝑒𝐼e(I) which is of dimension 450450450.\n\nThe overall number of trainable parameters in e𝑒e and f𝑓f is the same, as they share the same architecture. The number of trainable parameters in q𝑞q is 492⋅10+10⋅3=4950⋅49210⋅1034950492\\\\cdot 10+10\\\\cdot 3=4950 and in g𝑔g is 42⋅10+10⋅3=450⋅4210⋅10345042\\\\cdot 10+10\\\\cdot 3=450. Therefore, the embedding method is provided with a larger number of trainable parameters as q𝑞q is 101010 times larger than g𝑔g. The comparison is depicted in Fig. [6]Figure 6 ‣ 7.3 Image Colorization ‣ 7 Additional Experiments ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\").

Therefore, the only hyperparameter we used during the experiment is the learning rate. We conducted a hyperparameter sensitivity test for the learning rate. We compared the two models in the configuration of Sec. [5]Experiments ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\") when fixing the depths of f𝑓f and e𝑒e to be 444 and varying the learning rate. As can be seen in Fig. [7]Figure 7 ‣ 7.4 Sensitivity Experiment ‣ 7 Additional Experiments ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), the hypernetwork outperforms the baseline for every learning rate in which the networks provide non-trivial error rates.\n\n### 7.5 Validating Assumption 2\n\nTo empirically justify Assumption 2, we trained shallow neural networks on MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification with a varying number of hidden neurons. The optimization was done using the MSE loss, where the labels are cast into one-hot encoding. The network is trained using Adadelta with a learning rate of μ=1.0𝜇1.0\\\\mu=1.0 and batch size 646464 for 222 epochs. As can be seen in Fig. [8]Figure 8 ‣ 7.5 Validating Assumption 2 ‣ 7 Additional Experiments ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), the MSE loss strictly decreases when increasing the number of hidden neurons.

Several publications investigate this property. For instance, \\[ [2]), [44])\\] show that shallow neural networks are identifiable. The main result of \\[ [12])\\] considers feed-forward neural networks with the tanh\\\\tanh activation functions are shows that these are identifiable when the networks satisfy certain “genericity assumptions“. In \\[ [47])\\] it is shown that for a wide class of activation functions, one can find an arbitrarily close function that induces identifiability (see Lem. [2]Lemma 2 ([47]). ‣ 8.1 Identifiability ‣ 8 Preliminaries ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\")). Throughout the proofs of our Thm. [1]Theorem 1. ‣ 3 Degrees of Approximation ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), we make use of this last result in order to construct a robust approximator for the target functions of interest.\n\nWe recall the terminology of identifiability from \\[ [12]), [47])\\].\n\n###### Definition 2(Identifiability).\n\nA class 𝒻={f​(⋅;θf):A→B\\|θf∈Θ𝒻}𝒻conditional-set𝑓⋅subscript𝜃𝑓→𝐴conditional𝐵subscript𝜃𝑓subscriptΘ𝒻\\\\mathscr{f}=\\\\{f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\_{f}):A\\\\to B\\\\;\\|\\\\;\\\\theta\\_{f}\\\\in\\\\Theta\\_{\\\\mathscr{f}}\\\\} is identifiable up to (invariance) continuous functions Π={π:Θ𝒻→Θ𝒻}Πconditional-set𝜋→subscriptΘ𝒻subscriptΘ𝒻\\\\Pi=\\\\{\\\\pi:\\\\Theta\\_{\\\\mathscr{f}}\\\\to\\\\Theta\\_{\\\\mathscr{f}}\\\\}, if\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | f​(⋅;θf)≡Af​(⋅;θf′)⇔∃π∈Π​ s.t ​θf′=π​(θf)iffsubscript𝐴𝑓⋅subscript𝜃𝑓𝑓⋅subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑓𝜋Π s.t subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑓𝜋subscript𝜃𝑓f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta\\_{f})\\\\equiv\\_{A}f(\\\\cdot;\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{f})\\\\iff\\\\exists\\\\pi\\\\in\\\\Pi\\\\textnormal{ s.t }\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{f}=\\\\pi(\\\\theta\\_{f}) |  | (6) |\n\nwhere the equivalence ≡Asubscript𝐴\\\\equiv\\_{A} is equality for all x∈A𝑥𝐴x\\\\in A.\n\nA special case of identifiability is identifiability up to isomorphisms.

For a given neural network f​(x;\\[_W_,_b_\\])𝑓𝑥_W__b_f(x;\\[\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{W}},\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{b}}\\]) and isomorphism π𝜋\\\\pi, we denote by π∘\\[_W_,_b_\\]𝜋_W__b_\\\\pi\\\\circ\\[\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{W}},\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{b}}\\] the parameters of a neural network produced by the isomorphism π𝜋\\\\pi.\n\nAs noted by \\[ [12]), [47])\\], for a given class of neural networks, 𝒻𝒻\\\\mathscr{f}, there are several ways to construct pairs of non-isomorphic neural networks that are equivalent as functions.\n\nIn the first approach, suppose that we have a neural network with depth k≥2𝑘2k\\\\geq 2,\nand there exist indices i,j1,j2𝑖subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2i,j\\_{1},j\\_{2} with 1≤i≤k−11𝑖𝑘11\\\\leq i\\\\leq k-1 and 1≤j1<j2≤hi+11subscript𝑗1subscript𝑗2subscriptℎ𝑖11\\\\leq j\\_{1}<j\\_{2}\\\\leq h\\_{i+1}, such that, bj1i=bj2isubscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑗1subscriptsuperscript𝑏𝑖subscript𝑗2b^{i}\\_{j\\_{1}}=b^{i}\\_{j\\_{2}} and Wj1,ti=Wj2,tisubscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖subscript𝑗1𝑡subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖subscript𝑗2𝑡W^{i}\\_{j\\_{1},t}=W^{i}\\_{j\\_{2},t} for all t∈\\[hi\\]𝑡delimited-\\[\\]subscriptℎ𝑖t\\\\in\\[h\\_{i}\\].

Then, the two neural networks are equivalent, regardless of the activation function. The j1subscript𝑗1j\\_{1} and j2subscript𝑗2j\\_{2} neurons in the i𝑖i’th layer are called clones and are defined formally in the following manner.\n\n###### Definition 4(No-clones condition).\n\nLet class of neural networks 𝒻𝒻\\\\mathscr{f}. Let f​(x;\\[_W_,_b_\\])∈𝒻𝑓𝑥_W__b_𝒻f(x;\\[\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{W}},\\\\textbf{\\\\emph{b}}\\])\\\\in\\\\mathscr{f} be a neural network.

Suppose that we have a neural network with depth k≥2𝑘2k\\\\geq 2,\nand there exist indices i,j𝑖𝑗i,j with 1≤i≤k−11𝑖𝑘11\\\\leq i\\\\leq k-1 and 1≤j≤hi+11𝑗subscriptℎ𝑖11\\\\leq j\\\\leq h\\_{i+1}, such that, Wj,ti=0subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖𝑗𝑡0W^{i}\\_{j,t}=0 for all t∈\\[hi\\]𝑡delimited-\\[\\]subscriptℎ𝑖t\\\\in\\[h\\_{i}\\] or Wt,ji+1=0subscriptsuperscript𝑊𝑖1𝑡𝑗0W^{i+1}\\_{t,j}=0 for all t∈\\[hi+2\\]𝑡delimited-\\[\\]subscriptℎ𝑖2t\\\\in\\[h\\_{i+2}\\].

We say that f𝑓f is normal, if it has no-clones and is minimal. The set of normal neural networks within 𝒻𝒻\\\\mathscr{f} is denoted by 𝒻nsubscript𝒻𝑛\\\\mathscr{f}\\_{n}.\n\nAn interesting question regarding identifiability is whether a given activation σ:ℝ→ℝ:𝜎→ℝℝ\\\\sigma:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} function implies the identifiability property of any class of normal neural networks 𝒻nsubscript𝒻𝑛\\\\mathscr{f}\\_{n} with the given activation function are equivalent up to isomorphisms. An activation function of this kind will be called identifiability inducing.\nIt has been shown by \\[ [12])\\] that the tanh\\\\tanh is identifiability inducing up to additional restrictions on the weights. In \\[ [44])\\] and in \\[ [2])\\] they show that shallow neural networks are identifiable.\n\n###### Definition 7(Identifiability inducing activation).\n\nLet σ:ℝ→ℝ:𝜎→ℝℝ\\\\sigma:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be an activation function.

A multi-valued function is a mapping F:A→𝒫​(B):𝐹→𝐴𝒫𝐵F:A\\\\to\\\\mathcal{P}(B) from a set A𝐴A to the power set 𝒫​(B)𝒫𝐵\\\\mathcal{P}(B) of some set B𝐵B. To define the continuity of F𝐹F, we recall the Hausdorff distance \\[ [19]), [41])\\] between sets. Let dBsubscript𝑑𝐵d\\_{B} be a distance function over a set B𝐵B, the Hausdorff distance between two subsets E1,E2subscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2E\\_{1},E\\_{2} of B𝐵B is defined as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | dℋ​(E1,E2):=max⁡{supb1∈E1infb2∈E2dB​(b1,b2),supb2∈E2infb1∈E1dB​(b1,b2)}assignsubscript𝑑ℋsubscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2subscriptsupremumsubscript𝑏1subscript𝐸1subscriptinfimumsubscript𝑏2subscript𝐸2subscript𝑑𝐵subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2subscriptsupremumsubscript𝑏2subscript𝐸2subscriptinfimumsubscript𝑏1subscript𝐸1subscript𝑑𝐵subscript𝑏1subscript𝑏2\\\\displaystyle d\\_{\\\\mathcal{H}}(E\\_{1},E\\_{2}):=\\\\max\\\\Big{\\\\{}\\\\sup\\_{b\\_{1}\\\\in E\\_{1}}\\\\inf\\_{b\\_{2}\\\\in E\\_{2}}d\\_{B}(b\\_{1},b\\_{2}),\\\\sup\\_{b\\_{2}\\\\in E\\_{2}}\\\\inf\\_{b\\_{1}\\\\in E\\_{1}}d\\_{B}(b\\_{1},b\\_{2})\\\\Big{\\\\}} |  | (8) |\n\nIn general, the Hausdorff distance serves as an extended pseudo-metric, i.e., satisfies dℋ​(E,E)=0subscript𝑑ℋ𝐸𝐸0d\\_{\\\\mathcal{H}}(E,E)=0 for all E𝐸E, is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality, however, it can attain infinite values and there might be E1≠E2subscript𝐸1subscript𝐸2E\\_{1}\\\\neq E\\_{2}, such that, dℋ​(E1,E2)=0subscript𝑑ℋsubscript𝐸1subscript𝐸20d\\_{\\\\mathcal{H}}(E\\_{1},E\\_{2})=0.

Let f∈𝒻𝑓𝒻f\\\\in\\\\mathscr{f} be the best approximator of y𝑦y. Since f𝑓f is a 2-layered neural network, it takes the form:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | f​(x)=∑i=1dβi⋅σ​(αi​x+γi)𝑓𝑥subscriptsuperscript𝑑𝑖1⋅subscript𝛽𝑖𝜎subscript𝛼𝑖𝑥subscript𝛾𝑖f(x)=\\\\sum^{d}\\_{i=1}\\\\beta\\_{i}\\\\cdot\\\\sigma(\\\\alpha\\_{i}x+\\\\gamma\\_{i}) |  | (25) |\n\nBy \\[ [3])\\], we note that f𝑓f is a piece-wise linear function with k𝑘k pieces. We denote the end-points of those pieces by: −1=c0,…,ck=1formulae-sequence1subscript𝑐0…subscript𝑐𝑘1-1=c\\_{0},\\\\dots,c\\_{k}=1.

As a next step, we would like to apply this claim on 𝕐:=𝒲r,massign𝕐subscript𝒲𝑟𝑚\\\\mathbb{Y}:=\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m} and apply the lower bound of d~N​(𝒻;𝒲r,m)=Ω​(N−r/m)subscript~𝑑𝑁𝒻subscript𝒲𝑟𝑚Ωsuperscript𝑁𝑟𝑚\\\\tilde{d}\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m})=\\\\Omega(N^{-r/m}) to lower bound dN​(𝒻;𝕐)subscript𝑑𝑁𝒻𝕐d\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathbb{Y}). However, both of the classes 𝒻𝒻\\\\mathscr{f} and 𝕐𝕐\\\\mathbb{Y} include constant functions, and therefore, we have: 𝒻∩𝕐≠∅𝒻𝕐\\\\mathscr{f}\\\\cap\\\\mathbb{Y}\\\\neq\\\\emptyset. Hence, we are unable to assume that any y∈𝕐𝑦𝕐y\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Y} cannot be represented as a neural network with σ𝜎\\\\sigma activations.\n\nTo solve this issue, we consider a “wide” compact subset 𝕐′=𝒲r,mγsuperscript𝕐′subscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚\\\\mathbb{Y}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m} of 𝒲r,msubscript𝒲𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m} that does not include any constant functions, but still satisfies d~N​(𝒻;𝒲r,mγ)=Ω​(N−r/m)subscript~𝑑𝑁𝒻subscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚Ωsuperscript𝑁𝑟𝑚\\\\tilde{d}\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m})=\\\\Omega(N^{-r/m}).

In particular, by Lem. [17]Lemma 17. ‣ Proof sketch of Lem. 17 ‣ 9.2 Existence of a continuous selector ‣ 9 Proofs of the Main Results ‣ On the Modularity of Hypernetworks\"), we obtain the desired lower bound: dN​(𝒻;𝒲r,m)≥dN​(𝒻;𝒲r,mγ)=Θ​(d~N​(𝒻;𝒲r,mγ))=Ω​(N−r/m)subscript𝑑𝑁𝒻subscript𝒲𝑟𝑚subscript𝑑𝑁𝒻subscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚Θsubscript~𝑑𝑁𝒻subscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚Ωsuperscript𝑁𝑟𝑚d\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m})\\\\geq d\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m})=\\\\Theta(\\\\tilde{d}\\_{N}(\\\\mathscr{f};\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m}))=\\\\Omega(N^{-r/m}).\n\nFor this purpose, we provide some technical notations.

We notice that this set is compact, since it is closed and subset to the compact set 𝒲r,msubscript𝒲𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m} (see \\[ [1])\\]).\n\nNext, we would like to produce a lower bound for the N𝑁N-width of 𝒲r,mγsubscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m}. In \\[ [10]), [40])\\], in order to achieve a lower bound for the N𝑁N-width of 𝒲r,msubscript𝒲𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m}, two steps are taken. First, they prove that for any K⊂L∞​(\\[−1,1\\]m)𝐾superscript𝐿superscript11𝑚K\\\\subset L^{\\\\infty}(\\[-1,1\\]^{m}), we have: d~N​(K)≥bN​(K)subscript~𝑑𝑁𝐾subscript𝑏𝑁𝐾\\\\tilde{d}\\_{N}(K)\\\\geq b\\_{N}(K).

As a second step, they show that the Bernstein N𝑁N-width of 𝒲r,msubscript𝒲𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}\\_{r,m} is larger than Ω​(N−r/m)Ωsuperscript𝑁𝑟𝑚\\\\Omega(N^{-r/m}).\n\nUnfortunately, in the general case, Bernstein’s N𝑁N-width is very limited in its ability to estimate the nonlinear N𝑁N-width. When considering a set K𝐾K that is not centered around 00, Bernstein’s N𝑁N-width can be arbitrarily smaller than the actual nonlinear N𝑁N-width of K𝐾K. For example, if all of the members of K𝐾K are distant from 00, then, the Bernstein’s N𝑁N-width of K𝐾K is zero but the nonlinear N𝑁N-width of K𝐾K that might be large. Specifically, the Bernstein N𝑁N-width of 𝒲r,mγsubscriptsuperscript𝒲𝛾𝑟𝑚\\\\mathcal{W}^{\\\\gamma}\\_{r,m} is small even though intuitively, this set should have a similar width as the standard Sobolev space (at least for a small enough γ>0𝛾0\\\\gamma>0).

In this paper, we define the property of modularity as the\nability to effectively learn a different function for each input instance $I$.\nFor this purpose, we adopt an expressivity perspective of this property and\nextend the theory of Devore et al. 1996 and provide a lower bound on the\ncomplexity (number of trainable parameters) of neural networks as function\napproximators, by eliminating the requirements for the approximation method to\nbe robust. Our results are then used to compare the complexities of $q$ and\n$g$, showing that under certain conditions and when letting the functions $e$\nand $f$ be as large as we wish, $g$ can be smaller than $q$ by orders of\nmagnitude. This sheds light on the modularity of hypernetworks in comparison\nwith the embedding-based method. Besides, we show that for a structured target\nfunction, the overall number of trainable parameters in a hypernetwork is\nsmaller by orders of magnitude than the number of trainable parameters of a\nstandard neural network and an embedding method."

            "content": "Cognitive science and neuroscience hold a prominent place for (top-down) abstract task representations in many accounts of advanced cognitive functions in animals, including humans (Niv, [2019])). The brain not only represents the intermediate abstractions needed to perform a task but also actively maintains a representation of the task itself (i.e., task abstraction, (Mante et al., [2013]); Rikhye et al., [2018]); Zhou et al., [2019]); Vaidya et al., [2021]); Hummos et al., [2022]))). Such separation of the computation and its abstraction is theorized to support learning efficiency, as well as adaptive behavior. First, regarding learning efficiency, task abstractions facilitate learning by organizing experiences collected (Yu et al., [2021])). Human participants learn faster once they discover the underlying task structure (Badre et al., [2010]); Collins, [2017]); Vaidya et al., [2021]); Castañón et al., [2021])). In fact, humans have a bias to discover and use such latent task structures even when they do not exist or might hurt their performance (Gaissmaier & Schooler, [2008]); Collins, [2017])). Second, regarding adaptive behavior, previous work has shown that the brain updates these task abstractions to meet current task demands of the environment and (re)composes them to solve new problems (Miller & Cohen, [2001]); Collins & Koechlin, [2012])). Indeed, depending on the context, the brain is able to respond to the same sensory input in novel ways by composing an appropriate task abstraction that guides processing of the input (Rikhye et al., [2018]); Tafazoli et al., [2024])), supporting flexible decision making and generalization to novel situations (Collins & Koechlin, [2012]); Vaidya et al., [2021])).\n\nTraditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) architectures have a static computational graph that entangles input processing with task inference. For task-dependent computations in ANNs, one popular solution is to build in task representations in the networks. One solution is to build task representations into the structure of the network by using modular networks; where each module could represent a given task (Andreas et al., [2016]); Kirsch et al., [2018]); Goyal et al., [2019])). Alternatively, one could regularize the weight updates such as to maximize an orthogonal computational space for each task (Kirkpatrick et al., [2017]); Masse et al., [2018])). Our framework is most related to models that add task encoding input layers, which provide information about the current task demands to the network (Yang et al., [2019]); Hurtado et al., [2021]); Wang & Zhang, [2022])).\n\nHowever, these previous models lack two important task inference features which we unpack in what follows and motivate our work. First, these models do not propose a mechanism to efficiently identify these tasks if they appear again in data, and thereby flexibly (re)adapt to the demands of previously encountered task111This work sidesteps the challenge of unsupervised discovery of task abstractions, a problem tackled by several algorithms (Butz et al., [2019]); Xie et al., [2021]); Mazzaglia et al., [2022]); Hummos, [2023])). Second, and perhaps most importantly, these models lack a principled way of recomposing previously learned task abstractions, thereby minimizing the necessity for new learning (i.e. parameters update) to adapt to new situations (Lake et al., [2017])).\n\nTo address the challenge of an efficient inference mechanism that can capture the two properties just described, we propose Gradient-Based Inference (GBI) of task abstractions, a solution grounded in variational inference, offering a robust and flexible framework. While traditional variational models have employed a static encoder to map data to an approximate posterior over latent representations (e.g. (Kingma & Welling, [2013]))), they also have the potential to iteratively refine the posterior through rounds of optimization along gradients through the decoder (Rezende et al., [2014])). Previous models have used iterative optimization in latent space to discover latent tasks and associate them with an internally generated latent task embedding (Butz et al., [2019]); Hummos, [2023])). While these models were able to generalize and learn continually, the iterative refinement can be computationally demanding. GBI tackles the computational efficiency by investigating a role for the decoder gradients in lieu of likelihoods and reformulating them in probabilistic terms. We show that one-step gradient updates can provide an informative distribution that has sufficient accuracy and can support detecting OOD samples and estimating uncertainty.\n\nOur findings confirm that empirical findings from cognitive science do indeed extend to neural networks. In experiment 1 (toy dataset, section [3.1]Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\"), we show that ANN models provided with abstract task representations do in fact show faster learning (improved data-efficiency), improved generalization to novel data points, and reduced forgetting. Importantly, we also confirm that a neural network trained with these abstractions has all the information to infer them at test time through back-propagated gradients, acting as a generative model that can estimate the likelihood of each abstraction and how well it explains the input data. In experiment 2 (image classification, section [3.2]Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")), we first demonstrate that GBI can be used to perform image classification in a image generation setting. Second, we show that on-step gradient updates show interesting properties such as conveying uncertainty information and allowing for the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Third, we consider a larger dataset with more categories using CIFAR-100. Finally, in experiment 3 (language experiment, section [3.3]Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")), we show that GBI is a domain-general method, and demonstrate several GBI properties (i.e., task inference, data efficiency, generalization) in language modeling.",

Conceptually, a task abstraction groups data samples into conceptual categories defined across dataset samples rather than individual data points.

Our objective is\nexactly the expectation step with the regularization term H​(q)𝐻𝑞H(q) implemented as L2 regularization on 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z}.\n\nThere are different methods to optimize 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z} and we discuss two methods we use in this paper, iterative optimization and one-step gradient update below to obtain gradient-based inference (GBI) estimates over latent variable values.\n\n##### Iterative optimization of 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z}.\n\nOne method for doing gradient descent on 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z} is to iteratively optimize 𝐳𝐳\\\\mathbf{z} using the gradient ∂ℒ/∂𝐳ℒ𝐳{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}/{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{z}}. We implement iterative optimization using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and L2 regularization scaled by 0.01. This method usually takes many iterations (Marino et al., [2018])). Another method is to learn an update rule fϕ​(⋅)subscript𝑓italic-ϕ⋅f\\_{\\\\phi}(\\\\cdot) that converts the gradient directly into an inferred 𝐳←fϕ​(∂ℒ/∂𝐳)←𝐳subscript𝑓italic-ϕℒ𝐳\\\\mathbf{z}\\\\leftarrow f\\_{\\\\phi}({\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{L}}/{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{z}})(Marino et al., [2018])). This method allows for rapid inference during run time but requires training of the update rule (like other meta-learning methods).\n\n##### One-step gradient update.\n\nWe explore an alternative that requires only one pass through the model by updating the gradient only once. Without iteratively optimizing 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z} through gradient update, one-step gradient update usually heavily depends on the initialization: because if the initialization is far away from the optimal 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z}, the local gradient information might not be informative of the global optimum. However, notice that in the expectation step, our goal is to find the probability distribution of 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z}, q𝑞q, such that 𝔼q​\\[log⁡p​(𝐗,𝐙\\|θ)\\]+H​(q)subscript𝔼𝑞delimited-\\[\\]𝑝𝐗conditional𝐙𝜃𝐻𝑞\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{q}\\[\\\\log p(\\\\mathbf{X},\\\\mathbf{Z}\\|\\\\theta)\\]+H(q) is maximized.

Since entropy is concave, by increasing α𝛼\\\\alpha we make the function more concave and therefore the gradient is more informative of the actual optimum. Furthermore, qα∗subscriptsuperscript𝑞𝛼q^{\\*}\\_{\\\\alpha} will also become closer to the maximal entropy point q¯=arg⁡maxq⁡H​(q)¯𝑞subscript𝑞𝐻𝑞\\\\bar{q}=\\\\arg\\\\max\\_{q}H(q). Therefore we can choose our initialization point as the maximal entropy point and output q^^𝑞\\\\hat{q} using our one step gradient update rule:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | q^=softmax​(q¯+∇fα​(q¯)).^𝑞softmax¯𝑞∇subscript𝑓𝛼¯𝑞\\\\hat{q}=\\\\text{softmax}(\\\\bar{q}+\\\\nabla f\\_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\bar{q})). |  | (7) |\n\nHere, we use a softmax function to project q𝑞q back to the space of distribution. We implement this update using the SGD optimizer with learning rate 1 and no momentum terms. We reset our initialization point to maximal entropy to obtain q^^𝑞\\\\hat{q} for the next data point.\n\nCode available at [https://anonymous.4open.science/r/neuralbayes-F06F/].\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Sequence prediction task in one dimension.

The observations are generated from two alternating Gaussian distributions with distinct means (𝒩​(0.2,0.1)𝒩0.20.1\\\\mathcal{N}(0.2,0.1) or 𝒩​(0.8,0.1)𝒩0.80.1\\\\mathcal{N}(0.8,0.1), Fig [1]Figure 1 ‣ One-step gradient update. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") A, B). The ground truth generative causal model (Fig [1]Figure 1 ‣ One-step gradient update. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") A) has the task node (𝐳𝐳\\\\mathbf{z}) as a binary variable with values either 𝐳𝟏superscript𝐳1\\\\mathbf{z^{1}} = \\[0, 1\\] or 𝐳𝟐superscript𝐳2\\\\mathbf{z^{2}} = \\[1, 0\\]. Context node switched between those two values with a probability Pvsubscript𝑃𝑣P\\_{v} = 0.005, but we enforced a minimum block length of 20 and a maximum of 50 (further details in Appendix B).

We name this model GBI-LSTM and train it on the task (training details in appendix B), and in the following sections, we compare its learning dynamics to an LSTM with no such task input.\n\n##### GBI-LSTM is data efficient.\n\nGBI-LSTM learns the task faster (i.e. better data efficiency) (Fig [2]Figure 2 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") A,B). Example runs in appendix B (Fig S [9]Figure 9 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")), (LSTM, Fig S [8]Figure 8 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")).\nOn one hand, this seems obvious as the GBI-LSTM gets additional contextual information, but on the other hand, the task is simple enough that it is not clear that a 100-unit LSTM needs the additional information. To explain, we reasoned that the available task abstraction deeply influences what solutions the network learns and allows for modules to emerge for each task. We used ‘task variance’ to identify neurons active in each task, a measure used in neuroscience literature (Yang et al., [2019])). We identify active neurons by selecting units with the highest variance across samples of inputs and outputs for a task. We see that neurons for each task overlap in the LSTM but separate into modules in the GBI-LSTM, throughout training (Fig [2]Figure 2 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") C). At inference time, with weights frozen, the baseline LSTM handles task transitions efficiently (Fig S [8]Figure 8 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). The GBI-LSTM has the weights frozen but we now iteratively optimize the task abstraction layer z using vanilla SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.5 and we see that it also transitions between tasks by updating its task abstraction input z (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") A-C, Fig S [9]Figure 9 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Comparing the training loss of an LSTM trained with task input (GBI-LSTM) without task input (LSTM). Note the variability in these loss estimates despite the simulation run over 10 random seeds is due to the stochastic block transitions still coinciding frequently. B) We show the mean loss per block but exclude the initial 20 predictions in each block to exclude poor performance from either model limited to transitioning between tasks. C) We quantify the ratio of shared neurons active in the 0.2 blocks and the 0.8 blocks using ‘task variance’ to identify engaged neurons. We binned training blocks into groups of 5 to aggregate the data and increase accuracy.![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Neural network trained with task abstractions can dynamically tune itself to incoming data and generalizes to novel data points.

D) As a generalization test, while the network was trained on data from Gaussians with means 0.2 and 0.8, we test its responses to Gaussians between -0.2 to 1.2 (in 0.1 increments). We record the mean MSE values across 20 runs with different random seeds and compare to the baseline LSTM trained without task abstraction input. We only show runs where the last block of training was a 0.2 block, to highlight models behavior on that mean vs the other (0.8). E) The mean of the Gaussian data vs. the mean network predictions in each generalization block.

F-H) We show the other mode of using the same GBI-LSTM for gradient-based inference. We fix the task abstraction input Z to its state of maximum entropy (here \\[0.5, 0.5\\]) and take gradients from that point. While the network responds in the middle (F), the gradients w.r.t to Z (G) or similarly, the one-step gradient descent Z values behave much like the likelihood function, c.f. values computed using the Gaussian PDF in Fig [1]Figure 1 ‣ One-step gradient update. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") C.\n\n##### GBI-LSTM generalizes better and forgets less.\n\nGBI-LSTM generalizes better to values outside of the training range (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D). By using iterative optimization, a gradient step in 𝐙𝐙\\\\mathbf{Z} every time step, the GBI-LSTM can interpolate and better predict data points drawn from other distributions far from the two training distributions (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") E).\nMoreover, we observe that the baseline LSTM already shows signs of catastrophic forgetting in this very simple setting.\nTesting MSE is worse around one of the two training means depending on which mean generated the last block of data during training. In figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D, we show the responses from runs where the last training block had the 0.2 Gaussian mean active. In contrast, as quantified in Table [1]Table 1 ‣ GBI-LSTM generalizes better and forgets less. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") the GBI-LSTM shows no signs such forgetting (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") E).\n\nTable 1: Quantifying the generalization and forgetting on the toy task. Both models were trained on data generating means 0.2 and 0.8. We grouped models prediction errors on data generated from means -0.2 through 1.2 into four informative categories and evaluated mean MSE values ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm SEM. We identified the data generating mean during the last block of the training sequence, as the LSTM overfits to this mean and forgets data from the other mean. 20 runs with different seeds.\n\n| Data range | LSTM MSE | GBI-LSTM MSE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mean of the last training block (0.2 or 0.8) | 0.25 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.02 | 0.24±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.02 |\n| The other mean (0.2 or 0.8) | 0.30 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.03 | 0.24±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.02 |\n| Inside training range (0.3-0.7) | 0.27 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.02 | 0.25±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.01 |\n| Outside training range (<<0.2 & >>0.8) | 0.35 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.06 | 0.26±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.03 |\n\n##### Bayesian properties of GBI-LSTM.\n\nWe can use our GBI-LSTM for inference, i.e. approximate Bayesian quantities such as the posterior and the likelihood function of z. We distinguish between two ways we can use the GBI-LSTM, first by taking one-step gradient updates from maximal entropy points (‘default state’ mode) and second is the iterative optimization of the task abstraction z at a lower learning rate (‘task-engaged’ mode) which we used above to perform the task and generalize to novel data. In the ‘default state’ mode, we set the task abstraction layer to its state of maximum entropy (here, the mean of the two values observed in training). For each time step, we take one step in z space to lower the prediction error, and then reset to max entropy for the next point. These one step z values (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") H) behave much like the likelihoods of z computed through the ground truth causal model (Fig [1]Figure 1 ‣ One-step gradient update. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") C). (See Fig S [7]Figure 7 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") for a plot of the likelihoods and one gradient step z overlaid). Moreover, we see that these one step z can support Bayesian computations when used in lieu of the likelihood term in the Bayesian equation (previously calculated using the Gaussian probability distribution equation).\ni.e., we are able to pass one step z values to a Bayesian graphical model and Bayesian computations proceed normally (Fig S [6]Figure 6 ‣ B.1.2 Neural Model Architecture and Training ‣ B.1 Bayesian graphical model task ‣ Appendix B Bayesian Toy Dataset ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). As such, the Bayesian model was able to offload learning parts of the causal graph to the neural network, but maintained the ability to pass belief updates and messages across the directed graph, despite the grafting of a neural network in the graph.\n\nTable 2: GBI outperforms other gradient-based inference methods, and compares well to other canonical methods in ML (small drop in accuracy, but only one run through the neural network component). For iterative optimization, we further examine the relationship between optimization steps and accuracy in Fig S [13]Figure 13 ‣ Other gradient-based methods details. ‣ C.1 Further results on MNIST and confidence ‣ Appendix C MNIST ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\").\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Method | Accuracy (%) | Runs |\n| Canonical methods |  |  |\n| Classifier | 91.44 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.51 | 1 |\n| Pure generative | 81.91 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 2.3 | 10 |\n| Ours |  |  |\n| GBI | 85.46 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 3.60 | 1 |\n| Iterative Optimization | 88.51 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 3.42 | 50 |\n| Likelihood (Recon MSE) | 91.94 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 3.38 | 10 |\n| Other gradient-based methods |  |  |\n| EBI | 27.37 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 2.22 | 1 |\n| NBI | 78.78 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 1.21 | 10 |\n\n### 3.2 Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification\n\nWe next explore the properties of gradient-based inference in more complex datasets. We trained a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct MNIST digits. The decoder gets an additional input of a one-hot encoding of the digit label in addition to the latent embedding from the encoder (Fig [4]Figure 4 ‣ Advantages of GBI in image classification. ‣ 3.2 Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") Schematic). We train this structure for 4 epochs using an MSE reconstruction loss (full details in Appendix C). Conforming the results observed in the toy task, the network receiving additional digit label input trains faster compared with baseline autoencoder, (Fig S [12]Figure 12 ‣ Other gradient-based methods details. ‣ C.1 Further results on MNIST and confidence ‣ Appendix C MNIST ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")).\n\n##### Gradients infer image class.\n\nAt test time, we set the task abstraction (i.e., digit classes) input z to maximum entropy point and take one gradient step of the reconstruction loss with respect to the class inputs z, and directly interpret the resulting vector to infer the digit label. We make two kinds of comparison, first to methods that used gradient-based inference, we refer to them as entropy-based (Wortsman et al., [2020])) and norm-based inference(Roy et al., [2024])) and we see that GBI outperforms previous gradient-based methods (Table [2]Table 2 ‣ Bayesian properties of GBI-LSTM. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\"), implementation details in appendix C). Second, we compare GBI with four canonical methods to infer class based on the same architecture, as follows: (i) a convolutional classifier of the same architecture as the encoder, as a measure of what one might gain from a dedicated inference model that maps from inputs to task abstraction (in this case, digit class). (ii) iteratively optimizing the latent following the traditional variational inference paradigm (VI), which is the same as our model, but increases the computational budget by taking many smaller steps of gradient descent in task abstraction space. (iii) evaluating the model’s MSE loss at each digit one-hot encoding and selecting the one with lowest MSE loss, as a general representation of Bayesian methods that require evaluating a likelihood function over all hypotheses of interest. (iv) evaluating the model’s reconstruction MSE again, but in a purely generative model trained from task abstraction input to image reconstruction with no encoder, as an ablation to the separation of task input and task abstraction in our model. The goal: show that GBI suffers only a small drop in accuracy while offering a small computational budget and no added parameters. We see that GBI outperforms other gradient-based methods EBI and NBI, and show only a small drop in accuracy compared to canonical methods in machine learning (Table [2]Table 2 ‣ Bayesian properties of GBI-LSTM. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). We can also use our same model and increase the computational budget with iterative optimization or serial likelihood assessments when higher accuracy is required. More importantly, GBI offers a set of unique advantages as we discuss next.\n\n##### Advantages of GBI in image classification.\n\nGBI retains many of the desirable properties of a generative model and thus can evaluate the probability of the data under the model. Therefore, we reasoned that GBI may have an advantage in uncertainty estimation (Fig S [10]Figure 10 ‣ Other gradient-based methods details. ‣ C.1 Further results on MNIST and confidence ‣ Appendix C MNIST ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")) and in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) over traditional models. To test this, We compared a traditional convolutional classifier with GBI, both trained on MNIST digits and using fashionMNIST clothing items as the OOD dataset (Xiao et al., [2017])). Using one gradient step task abstraction layer logits, GBI is superior at detecting OOD samples compared with the convolutional classifier (figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ Advantages of GBI in image classification. ‣ 3.2 Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). In comparing our OOD detection results to current state-of-the-art methods we noted that the standard setup in studying OOD detection does not involve normalizing the image brightness mean and variance, making it trivial to discriminate the in and out-of-distribution datasets. We compared our OOD results to the Likelihood Regret (LR) method for OOD detection in a generative model Xiao et al. ( [2020])) (see supplementary material for implementation details). On unnormalized data samples, where detection methods can take advantage of differences in pixel intensities between the in and out-of-distribution samples, both GBI and LR perform high (Fig A [14]Figure 14 ‣ Appendix D OOD Detection ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\"), Table A [6]Table 6 ‣ Appendix D OOD Detection ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). However, when data samples are normalized GBI shows a clear advantage over LR (table [3]Table 3 ‣ Advantages of GBI in image classification. ‣ 3.2 Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). Lastly, we provide an illustration of how the GBI framework enables adaptive behavior, where in response to the same input (image), changing the task abstraction (the digit label) can lead to a different input-to-output transformation, allowing for an additional layer of flexibility in task selection (Fig S [11]Figure 11 ‣ Other gradient-based methods details. ‣ C.1 Further results on MNIST and confidence ‣ Appendix C MNIST ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")).\n\nTable 3: One gradient step values in GBI show better OOD detection compared to classifier logit and state-of-the-art method. AUCROC values averaged over 10 seeds with standard deviations reported. We examine the case when pixel intensity statistics were normalized so methods are not trivially detecting changes in brightness between the in-distribution and OOD datasets. Unnormalized results in Tab S [6]Table 6 ‣ Appendix D OOD Detection ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")\n\n| Method | AUCROC |\n| --- | --- |\n| GBI | 0.89±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.03 |\n| Classifier Softmax Maxes | 0.73 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.08 |\n| Likelihood Regret | 0.80 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.06 |\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) samples detection in a GBI autoencoder compared to a classifier. Both models were trained on MNIST digits, and tested on OOD dataset fashionMNIST. We take the A) max value of the task abstraction layer in GBI and for the B) logits in the classifier and consider how are they distributed for in-distribution samples and OOD samples. C) ROC curves show that GBI max values are more discriminative.\n\n##### CIFAR-100.\n\nWe apply GBI to the CIFAR-100 dataset, which features color images of vehicles, animals with diverse backgrounds. The GBI accuracy 18% well above that obtained from a pure generative model (Table [4]Table 4 ‣ CIFAR-100. ‣ 3.2 Experiment 2: GBI properties for image classification ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")) (i.e. a model to decode image class to image directly). This suggests a positive effect from the separation of visual input and task abstraction streams. We see only a small drop between evaluating the likelihood of each image class for each image (requires one for each of the 100 image classes, accuracy 21%) and GBI which requires only 1 run. Of note, we switched from an additive task abstraction to a multiplicative interaction to improve the accuracy, as backpropagation found solutions that favors relying on the visual input features rather than image class input (Table S [8]Table 8 ‣ E.1 Further experimental details on training task-aware language model ‣ Appendix E Language Model ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\")). This observation coupled with the overall low accuracy from the pure generative model suggests that image class input does not significantly reduce the variance seen in pixel space, leading the decoder to favor the visual features from the encoder. We anticipate that scaling to larger datasets will benefit from richer task abstractions. This highlights a role for algorithms that discover such abstractions from data (Butz et al., [2019]); Hummos, [2023])).\n\nTable 4: GBI accuracy on CIFAR100 using a multiplicative task abstraction. The task abstraction is projected through a frozen embedding layer ( Bernoulli distribution) then multiplies the visual information going to decoder.\n\n| Method | Test Accuracy (%) | Model runs |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pure generative | 9.57 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.19 | 100 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GBI | 18.52 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.38 | 1 |\n| Iterative optimization | 18.53 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.38 | 400 |\n| Likelihood | 21.30 ±plus-or-minus\\\\pm 0.36 | 100 |\n\n### 3.3 Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling\n\nWe apply the concepts demonstrated in the Bayesian toy dataset and the MNIST classifier to language modelling for a self-supervised sequence modeling task. Specifically, we are interested in the effects of providing a task representation on data-efficiency, training dynamics and the ability to generalize, as observed in the case of the Bayesian toy dataset (Fig [1]Figure 1 ‣ One-step gradient update. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\"), [2]Figure 2 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\"), [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D,E).\n\n##### Method\n\nWe train an LSTM (with 2 layers, 200 units each) on word-level language prediction and compare an LSTM with our GBI-LSTM. To demonstrate the effectiveness of task abstractions in this setting, we represent each task abstraction as a one-hot encoded identifier of each training dataset. We use datasets included in the BabyLM challenge (Warstadt et al., [2023])), which provides 10 datasets inspired by what language data children might be exposed to during development, including wikipedia dataset, movie subtitles, children stories, and adult conversations, amongst others (listed in Appendix E). We train the two models on 3 of these datasets in a setting analogous to the Bayesian model dataset described earlier with data in each batch randomly drawn from one of the three datasets (we vary the choice of the 3 training datasets across seeds). The GBI-LSTM receives additional input with a one-hot encoded dataset identifier during training concatenated to the input token at each time step.\n\nDuring testing, we use one-step gradients to infer the dataset from the text data provided as we assume no access to the dataset identifier at test time. We then use iterative optimization of the task abstraction input z to adapt the model to novel datasets by taking gradients steps on one batch of data and evaluating on the test set.\n\n##### Results\n\nFirst, we focus on the effect of task abstractions on data-efficiency. Compared with the LSTM, GBI-LSTM displays lower training and validation losses (Fig [5]Figure 5 ‣ Results ‣ 3.3 Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") A, B). While the improvement is modest, we emphasize that we only had to add <1.61.61.6 bits of information to obtain it.\n\nSecond, we focus on task inference. We show that GBI can quickly and reliably infer the dataset at hand, and in fact, it takes a few words from the first batch to accurately infer the dataset (Fig [5]Figure 5 ‣ Results ‣ 3.3 Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") C). Note that similar to likelihood functions, gradient inference can handle variable amounts of evidence, and the estimation accuracy scales with the amount of evidence available.\n\nThird, we focus on generalization. Our results show that task abstraction layers improves the model’s ability to generalize to novel tasks (Fig [5]Figure 5 ‣ Results ‣ 3.3 Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D), similar to the case in the synthetic Bayesian dataset (Fig [3]Figure 3 ‣ GBI-LSTM is data efficient. ‣ 3.1 Experiment 1: The impact of task abstractions and the dynamics of GBI in a toy dataset ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D,E). We use a 4th dataset not seen during training, and we compare the GBI-LSTM and LSTM losses on this novel dataset. To allow gradient descent to compose the closest solution to the novel datasets, we optimize the task abstraction input nodes of the GBI-LSTM to lower its prediction loss and we see a decrease in loss as it adjusts to this new unseen dataset (Fig [5]Figure 5 ‣ Results ‣ 3.3 Experiment 3: Task-aware language modeling ‣ 3 Experiments ‣ Gradient-based inference of abstract task representations for generalization in neural networks\") D) (See Appendix E for example run). Notably, the GBI-LSTM starts out at a higher loss, on average, highlighting that task-aware models require task inference.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Better data-efficiency in an LSTM trained with task abstraction input (dataset ID one-hot) (GBI-LSTM) compared to training without such input (LSTM). Cross entropy loss for GBI-LSTM decreases faster for GBI-LSTM on the A) training set and B) testing set. Note that we train with a word-level tokenizer with a larger output dimension which has a highe cross entropy loss upper bound ( 12). Each simulation run had three language datasets picked randomly from 10 datasets. 10 data set picks, each run for 3 random seeds, shaded area SEM. C) One-pass gradient-based inference can infer dataset ID accurately at test time needing only a few words. GBI-LSTM takes a sequence of words available and outputs predictions over the same sequence shifted by one token (sequence to sequence modeling). We take the gradients w.r.t the task abstraction inputs and use the gradients to infer dataset ID. We show examples from 3 datasets to show variability. D) Iterative optimization can be used to adapt a GBI-LSTM to a novel dataset. We compare it to optimizing the inputs of an LSTM that was trained with no task provided to rule out any generic optimization effects. Due to the variability of loss values across datasets, for each dataset, we take the mean and SEM over 4 seeds and then aggregate the results across datasets.",

          "4 Conclusions and future directions": {
            "content": "Overall we show that neural networks with access to task abstractions learn faster, forget less, adapt to changes in data distribution, and generalize to new situations. At the same time, we also provide tools for the networks to function independently infer their own task abstractions during testing. These task abstractions can be provided by humans, a trained teacher model, or inferred from data with no supervision (e.g. (Hummos, [2023]))). Task-dependent networks require task inference and inferring an incorrect task impairs function. In animal brains, some computations that are frequently needed or are critical for survival might be better mapped to the default state of the brain. The brain shows distinct dynamics when not engaged in a specific task, the default mode, and we show previously unexplored connections between feedback signals in this default state and distributional inference signals that can support many probabilistic quantities such as uncertainty and surprise. We see future work addressing the limitation of relying on human-provided task abstractions as opposed to unsupervised discovery of richer multidimensional task representations along dimensions important for adaptation and generalization. Finally, while our method is theoretically motivated, we see future work extending these findings to larger datasets and more real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "Humans and many animals show remarkably adaptive behavior and can respond\ndifferently to the same input depending on their internal goals.

For such benefits to emerge, one needs\na task inference mechanism that possesses two crucial abilities: First, the\nability to infer abstract task representations when no longer explicitly\nprovided (task inference), and second, manipulate task representations to adapt\nto novel problems (task recomposition).

          "1 Introduction": {
            "content": "Neural Network (NN) approaches to modeling dynamical systems have recently raised the interest of several communities leading to an increasing number of contributions.\nThis topic was explored in several domains, ranging from simple dynamics e.g. Hamiltonian systems (Greydanus et al., [2019]); Chen et al., [2020b])) to more complex settings e.g. fluid dynamics (Kochkov et al., [2021]); Li et al., [2021]); Wandel et al., [2021])), earth system science and climate (Reichstein et al., [2019])), or health (Fresca et al., [2020])).\nNN emulators are attractive as they may for example provide fast and low cost approximations to complex numerical simulations (Duraisamy et al., [2019]); Kochkov et al., [2021])), complement existing simulation models when the physical law is partially known (Yin et al., [2021b])) or even offer solutions when classical solvers fail e.g. with very high number of variables (Sirignano & Spiliopoulos, [2018])).\n\nA model of a real-world dynamical system should account for a wide range of contexts resulting from different external forces, spatio-temporal conditions, boundary conditions, sensors characteristics or system parameters.\nThese contexts characterize the dynamics phenomenon.\nFor instance, in cardiac electrophysiology (Neic et al., [2017]); Fresca et al., [2020])), each patient has its own specificities and represents a particular context.\nIn the study of epidemics’ diffusion (Shaier et al., [2021])), computational models should handle a variety of spatial, temporal or even sociological contexts.\nThe same holds for most physical problems, e.g. forecasting of spatial-location-dependent dynamics in climate (de Bézenac et al., [2018])), fluid dynamics prediction under distinct external forces (Li et al., [2021])), etc.\n\nThe physics approach for modeling dynamical systems relies on a strong prior knowledge about the underlying phenomenon. This provides a causal mechanism which is embedded in a physical dynamics model, usually a system of differential equations, and allows the physical model to handle a whole set of contexts.\nMoreover, it is often possible to adapt the model to new or evolving situations, e.g. via data assimilation (Kalman, [1960]); Courtier et al., [1994])).\n\nIn contrast, Expected Risk Minimization (ERM) based machine learning (ML) fails to generalize to unseen dynamics. Indeed, it requires i.i.d. data for training and inference while dynamical observations are non-i.i.d. as the distributions change with initial conditions or physical contexts.\n\nThus any ML framework that handles this question should consider other assumptions.\nA common one used e.g. in domain generalization (Wang et al., [2021b])), states that data come from several environments a.k.a. domains, each with a different distribution.\nTraining is performed on a sample of the environments and test corresponds to new ones.\nDomain generalization methods attempt to capture problem invariants via a unique model, assuming that there exists a representation space suitable for all the environments.\nThis might be appropriate for classification, but not for dynamical systems where the underlying dynamics differs for each environment.\nFor this problem, we need to learn a function that adapts to each environment, based on a few observations, instead of learning a single domain-invariant function.\nThis is the objective of meta-learning (Thrun & Pratt, [1998])), a general framework for fast adaptation to unknown contexts.\nThe standard gradient-based methods (e.g. Finn et al., [2017])) are unsuitable for complex dynamics due to their bi-level optimization and are known to overfit when little data is available for adaptation, as in the few-shot learning setting explored in this paper (Mishra et al., [2018])).\nLike invariant methods, meta-learning usually handles basic tasks e.g. classification; regression on static data or simple sequences and not challenging dynamical systems.\n\nGeneralization for modeling real-world dynamical systems is a recent topic.\nSimple simulated dynamics were considered in Reinforcement Learning (Lee et al., [2020]); Clavera et al., [2019])) while physical dynamics were modeled in recent works (Yin et al., [2021a]); Wang et al., [2021c])).\nThese approaches consider either simplified settings or additional hypotheses e.g. prior knowledge and do not offer general solutions to our adaptation problem (details in [Section6]Related Work ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\")).\n\nWe propose a new ML framework for generalization in dynamical systems, called Context-Informed Dynamics Adaptation (CoDA).\nLike in domain generalization, we assume availability of several environments, each with its own specificity, yet sharing some physical properties.\nTraining is performed on a sample of the environments.\nAt test time, we assume access to example data from a new environment, here a trajectory.\nOur goal is to adapt to the new environment distribution with this trajectory.\nMore precisely, CoDA assumes that the underlying system is described by a parametrized differential equation, either an ODE or a PDE.\nThe environments share the parametrized form of the equation but differ by the values of the parameters or initial conditions.\nCoDA conditions the dynamics model on learned environment characteristics a.k.a. contexts and generalizes to new environments and trajectories with few data.\nOur main contributions are the following:\n\n- •\n\n\nWe introduce a multi-environment formulation of the generalization problem for dynamical systems.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe propose a novel context-informed framework, CoDA, to this problem. It conditions the dynamics model on context vectors via a hypernetwork.\nCoDA introduces a locality and a low-rank constraint, which enable fast and efficient adaptation with few data.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe analyze theoretically the validity of our low-rank adaptation setting for modeling dynamical systems.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe evaluate two variations of CoDA on several ODEs/PDEs representative of a variety of application domains, e.g. chemistry, biology, physics. CoDA achieves SOTA generalization results on in-domain and one-shot adaptation scenarios. We also illustrate how, with minimal supervision, CoDA infers accurately new system parameters from learned contexts.\n\n\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nIn [Section2]Generalization for Dynamical Systems ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\"), we present our multi-environment problem.\nIn [Section3]The CoDA Learning Framework ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\"), we introduce the CoDA framework.\nIn [Section4]Framework Implementation ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\"), we detail how to implement our framework.\nIn [Section5]Experiments ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\"), we present our experimental results.\nIn [Section6]Related Work ‣ Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\"), we present related work.",

( [2019])).\nThis decoder-only strategy is particularly efficient and flexible in our setting.\nAn alternative is to infer them via a learned encoder of 𝒟esuperscript𝒟𝑒\\\\mathcal{D}^{e} as Garnelo et al. ( [2018])).\nYet, the latter was observed to underfit (Kim et al., [2019])), requiring extensive tuning of the encoder and decoder architecture.\nOverall, CoDA is easy to implement and maintains expressivity with a linear decoder.",

            "content": "The compilation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\nis now the norm across hospitals in the United States.\nA patient record may be viewed\nas a sequence of diagnoses, surgeries, laboratory values and drugs prescribed over time.\nThe wide availability of these records now allows us to apply machine learning techniques to answer\nmedical questions: What is the best course of treatment for a patient? Between two drugs,\ncan we determine which will save a patient? Can we find patients who are “similar”\nto each other? Our paper introduces new techniques for learning _causal_ generative temporal models from noisy high-dimensional data, that we believe is the first step towards addressing these questions.\n\nWe seek to model the change of the patient’s state over time. We do this by learning a\nrepresentation of the patient that (1) evolves over time and (2) is sensitive to the effect of the actions taken by doctors.\nIn particular, the approach we adopt is to learn a time-varying, generative model of patients.\n\nModelling temporal data is a well studied problem in machine learning.\nModels such as the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\nhave been proposed to model the probability of sequences.\nHere, we consider a widely used probabilistic model: Kalman filters (Kalman,, [1960])).\nClassical Kalman filters are linear dynamical systems, that have enjoyed remarkable success in the last few decades.\nFrom their use in GPS to weather systems and speech recognition models,\nfew other generative models of sequential data have enjoyed such widespread adoption across many domains.\n\nIn classical Kalman filters, the latent state evolution as well as the\nemission distribution and action effects are modelled as linear functions perturbed by Gaussian noise.\nHowever, for real world applications the use of linear transition and emission distribution limits the capacity to model complex phenomena,\nand modifications to the functional form of Kalman filters have been proposed.\nFor example, the Extended Kalman Filter (Jazwinski,, [2007])) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (Wan et al. ,, [2000]))\nare two different methods to learn temporal models with non-linear transition and emission distributions (see also Roweis & Ghahramani, ( [2000])) and Haykin, ( [2004]))).\nThe addition of non-linearities to the model makes learning more difficult. Raiko & Tornio, ( [2009])) explored ways of using linear approximations\nand non-linear dynamical factor analysis in order to overcome these difficulties. However,\ntheir methods do not handle long-range temporal interactions and scale quadratically with the latent dimension.\n\nWe show that recently developed techniques in variational inference (Rezende et al. ,, [2014]); Kingma & Welling,, [2013])) can be adopted\nto learn a broad class of the Kalman filters that exist in the literature using a single algorithm.\nFurthermore, using deep neural networks, we can enhance\nKalman filters with arbitrarily complex transition dynamics and emission distributions.\nWe show that we can tractably learn such models\nby optimizing a bound on the likelihood of the data.\n\nKalman filters have been used extensively for optimal control, where the model attempts to capture\nhow actions affect the observations, precipitating the task of choosing the best control signal towards a given objective. We use Kalman filters for a different yet closely related task: performing counterfactual inference.\nIn the medical setting, counterfactual inference attempts to model the effect of an intervention such as a surgery or a drug, on an outcome, e.g. whether the patient survived. The hardness of this problem lies in the fact that\ntypically, for a single patient, we only see one intervention-outcome pair (the patient cannot have taken and not taken the drug).\nThe key point here is that by modelling the sequence of observations such as diagnoses and lab reports, as well as the interventions or actions (in the form of surgeries and drugs administered) across patients, we hope to learn the effect of interventions on\na patient’s future state.\n\nWe evaluate our model in two settings. First we introduce “Healing MNIST”, a dataset of perturbed, noisy and rotated MNIST digits. We show our model captures both short- and long-range effects of actions performed on these digits. Second, we use EHR data from 8,00080008,000 diabetic and pre-diabetic patients gathered over 4.5 years.\nWe investigate various kinds of Kalman filters learned using our framework and\nuse our model to learn the effect anti-diabetic medication has on patients.\n\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n- •\n\n\nDevelop a method for probabilistic generative modelling of sequences of complex observations, perturbed by non-linear actions, using deep neural nets as a building block.\nWe derive a bound on the log-likelihood\nof sequential data and an algorithm to learn a broad class of Kalman filters.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe evaluate the efficacy of different recognition distributions for inference and learning.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe consider this model for use in counterfactual inference\nwith emphasis on the medical setting.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the use of continuous state space models\nhas not been considered\nfor this goal.\nOn a synthetic setting we empirically validate that our model is able to capture\npatterns within a very noisy setting and model the effect of external actions. On real patient data we show that our model can successfully perform counterfactual inference to show the effect of anti-diabetic drugs on diabetic patients.",

For example, in the medical setting, one is often interested in questions such as “What would the patient’s blood sugar level be had she taken a different medication?”. Knowing the answers to such questions could lead to better and more efficient healthcare. We are interested in providing better answers to this type of questions, by leveraging the power of large-scale Electronic Health Records.\n\nPearl, ( [2009])) framed the problem of counterfactual estimation in the language of graphical models and _do_-calculus.\nIf one knows the graphical model of the variables in question, then for some structures estimation of counterfactuals is possible by setting a variable of interest (e.g. medication prescribed) to a given value and performing inference on a derived sub-graph.\nIn this work, we do not seek to learn the true underlying causal graph structure but rather seek to use _do_-calculus to\nobserve the effect of interventions under a causal interpretation of the model we posit.",

The first is trained to construct a compact representation stsubscript𝑠𝑡s\\_{t}\nto predict the xt+1subscript𝑥𝑡1x\\_{t+1} from xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x\\_{t}, the second uses st−1subscript𝑠𝑡1s\\_{t-1} and xt−1subscript𝑥𝑡1x\\_{t-1} to predict stsubscript𝑠𝑡s\\_{t}.

Finally, the time varying “memory” of their resulting generative model is both deterministic and\nstochastic whereas ours is entirely stochastic. i.e our model retains the Markov\nProperty and other conditional independence statements held by Kalman filters.\n\nLearning Kalman filters with\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons was considered by Raiko & Tornio, ( [2009])).\nThey approximate the posterior using non-linear dynamic factor analysis (Valpola & Karhunen,, [2002])), which scales quadratically with the latent dimension.\nRecently, Watter et al. , ( [2015]))\nuse temporal generative models\nfor optimal control.\nWhile [Watter et al. ,]) aim to learn a locally linear latent dimension within which to perform optimal control,\nour goal is different: we wish to model the data in order to perform counterfactual inference.\nTheir training algorithm relies on approximating the bound on the likelihood by training\non consecutive pairs of observations.\n\nIn general, control applications deal with domains where the effect of action is instantaneous, unlike in the medical setting. In addition, most control scenarios involve a setting such as controlling a robot arm where the control signal has a major effect on the observation; we contrast this with the medical setting where medication can often have a weak impact on the patient’s state, compared with endogenous and environmental factors.\n\nFor a general introduction to estimating expected counterfactual effects over a population - see Morgan & Winship, ( [2014])); Höfler, ( [2005])); Rosenbaum, ( [2002])).

First, it tells us how we can\nuse the Markov structure of our graphical model to simplify the posterior\nthat any qϕ​(z→)subscript𝑞italic-ϕ→𝑧q\\_{\\\\phi}(\\\\vec{z}) must approximate. Second, it yields insight on how to design\napproximations to the true posterior. Indeed this motivated the factorization of qϕsubscript𝑞italic-ϕq\\_{\\\\phi} in Eq. [3]In 5.1 Maximizing a Lower Bound ‣ 5 Learning using Stochastic Backpropagation ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\").\nFurthermore, instead of using a bi-directional RNN\nto approximate p​(zt\\|x→,u→)𝑝conditionalsubscript𝑧𝑡→𝑥→𝑢p(z\\_{t}\\|\\\\vec{x},\\\\vec{u}) by summarizing both the past and the future (x1,…,xTsubscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑇x\\_{1},\\\\ldots,x\\_{T}),\none can approximate\nthe same posterior distribution using a single RNN that summarizes the future (xt,…,xTsubscript𝑥𝑡…subscript𝑥𝑇x\\_{t},\\\\ldots,x\\_{T}) as\nlong as one also conditions on the previous latent\nstate (zt−1subscript𝑧𝑡1z\\_{t-1}). Here, zt−1subscript𝑧𝑡1z\\_{t-1} serves as a summary of x1,…,xt−1subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑡1x\\_{1},\\\\ldots,x\\_{t-1}.\n\nFor the stochastic backpropagation model, the variational lower bound is tight if and only if KL(qϕ(z\\|x)\\|\\|pθ(z\\|x))=0\\\\operatorname{KL}(q\\_{\\\\phi}(z\\|x)\\|\\|p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\|x))=0. In that case, we have that ℒ​(x;(θ,ϕ))=log⁡pθ​(x)ℒ𝑥𝜃italic-ϕsubscript𝑝𝜃𝑥\\\\mathcal{L}(x;(\\\\theta,\\\\phi))=\\\\log p\\_{\\\\theta}(x), and the optimization objective ( [5.1]Maximizing a Lower Bound ‣ 5 Learning using Stochastic Backpropagation ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\")) reduces to a maximum likelihood objective.\nIn the stochastic backpropagation literature, the variational distribution qϕ​(z\\|x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q\\_{\\\\phi}(z\\|x) is usually Gaussian and therefore cannot be expected to be equal to pθ​(z\\|x)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑧𝑥p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\|x). An interesting question is whether using the idea of the universality of normalizing flows (Tabak et al. ,, [2010]); Rezende & Mohamed,, [2015])) one can transform qϕ​(z\\|x)subscript𝑞italic-ϕconditional𝑧𝑥q\\_{\\\\phi}(z\\|x) to be equal (or arbitrarily close) to pθ​(z\\|x)subscript𝑝𝜃conditional𝑧𝑥p\\_{\\\\theta}(z\\|x) and thus attain equality in the lower bound. Such a result leads to a consistency result for the learned model, stemming from the consistency of maximum likelihood.\n\n### 5.3 Counterfactual Inference\n\nHaving learned a generative temporal model, we can use the model to perform counterfactual inference.\nFormally, consider a scenario where we are interested in evaluating the effect of an intervention\nat time t𝑡t.\nWe can perform inference on the set of observations: {x1,…,xt,u1,…,ut−1}subscript𝑥1…subscript𝑥𝑡subscript𝑢1…subscript𝑢𝑡1\\\\{x\\_{1},\\\\ldots,x\\_{t},u\\_{1},\\\\ldots,u\\_{t-1}\\\\}\nusing the learned qϕsubscript𝑞italic-ϕq\\_{\\\\phi}.

We can forward sample from this latent state in order to contrast the expected effect of different actions.",

Surgeries and drugs\nvary in their effect as a function of patient age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidities.\nLaboratory measurements are often noisy, and diagnoses\nmay be tentative, redundant or delayed. In insurance health claims data, the situation\nis further complicated by arcane, institutional specific\npractices that determine how decisions made by healthcare professions are\nrepurposed into codes used for reimbursements.\n\nTo mimic learning under such harsh conditions, we consider a synthetic dataset derived from the MNIST Handwritten Digits (LeCun & Cortes,, [2010])).\nWe select several digits and create a synthetic dataset where rotations are performed to the digits. The rotations are encoded as the actions (u→→𝑢\\\\vec{u})\nand the rotated images as the observations (x→→𝑥\\\\vec{x}). This realizes a sequence of rotated images. To each such generated training sequence,\nexactly one sequence of three consecutive squares is superimposed with the top-left\ncorner of the images in a random starting location, and add up to 20% bit-flip noise. We consider two experiments: Small Healing MNIST, using a single example of the digit 111 and digit 555, and Large Healing MNIST where\n100100100 different digits (one hundred 5’s and one hundred 1’s) are used. The training set comprises approximately 400004000040000 sequences of length five for Small Healing MNIST, and 140000140000140000 sequences of length five for Large Healing MNIST.\nThe large dataset represents the temporal evolution of two distinct subpopulations\nof patients (of size 100100100 each). The squares within the sequences are intended to be analogous to seasonal flu or other ailments\nthat a patient could exhibit that are independent of the actions and which last several timesteps.\n\nThe challenges present within this dataset are numerous.\n(1) Image data is intrinsically high dimensional and much recent work has focused on learning\npatterns from it. It represents a setting where the posterior is complex and often requires\nhighly non-linear models in order to approximate it.\nThe additions of rotated images to the training data adds more complexity to the task.\n(2) In order to learn through random noise that is this high,\none needs to have a model of sequences capable of performing “filtering”.\nModels that rely on predicting the next image based on the previous\none (Goroshin et al. ,, [2015]); Memisevic,, [2013])) may not suffice to learn the structure of digits in the presence of large noise and rotation.\nFurthermore, long-range patterns - e.g. the three consecutive blocks in the upper-left corner - that exist in the data are beyond the scope of such models.\n\nWe learn models using the four recognition models described in Section [5]Learning using Stochastic Backpropagation ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\").\nFigure [2(a)]In Figure 2 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") shows examples of training sequences (marked TS) from Large Healing MNIST provided to the model,\nand their corresponding reconstructions (marked R).\nThe reconstructions are performed by feeding the input sequence into the learned recognition network,\nand then sampling from the resulting posterior distribution. Recall that the model posits x→→𝑥\\\\vec{x} drawn\nfrom an independent Bernoulli distribution whose mean parameters (denoted mean probabilities) we visualize. We discuss results in more detail below.\n\n![Refer to caption](a) Reconstruction during training\n\n![Refer to caption](b) Samples: Different rotations\n\n![Refer to caption](c) Inference on unseen digits\n\nFigure 2: Large Healing MNIST.

(c) Counterfactual Reasoning. We reconstruct variants of the digits 5,1515,1 _not_ present in the training set, with (bottom) and without (top) bit-flip noise. We infer a sequence of 1 timestep and display the reconstructions from the posterior. We then keep the latent state and perform forward sampling and reconstruction from the generative model under a constant\nright rotation.\n\n![Refer to caption](a) Samples from models trained with different qϕsubscript𝑞italic-ϕq\\_{\\\\phi}\n\n![Refer to caption](b) Test Log-Likelihood for models trained with different qϕsubscript𝑞italic-ϕq\\_{\\\\phi}\n\nFigure 3: Small Healing MNIST: (a) Mean probabilities sampled under different variational models with a constant, large rotation applied to the right. (b) Test log-likelihood under different recognition models.\n\n### Small Healing MNIST: Comparing Recognition Models\n\nWe evaluated the impact of different variational models on learning by examining test log-likelihood and by visualizing the samples generated by the models.\nSince q-RNN and q-BRNN have more parameters by virtue of their internal structure,\nwe added layers to the q-INDEP network (6 layers) and q-LR network (4 layers) until training on the dataset was infeasible - i.e. did not make any gains after more than 100 epochs of training222In particular, we found that\nadding layers to the variational model helped but only up to a certain point. Beyond that, learning the model was infeasible.. Figure [3(b)]In Figure 3 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") depicts the log-likelihood under the test set (we estimate test log-likelihood using importance sampling based on the recognition network - see Supplemental Section A). Figure [3(a)]In Figure 3 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") depicts pairs of sequence samples obtained under each of the variational models.\n\nIt is unsurprising that q-BRNN outperforms the other variants. In a manner similar to the Forward-Backward algorithm,\nthe Bi-Directional RNN summarizes the past and the future at every timestep to form the most effective approximation to the posterior distribution\nof ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z\\_{t}.\n\nIt is also not surprising that q-INDEP performs poorly, both in the quality of the samples and\nin held out log-likelihood. Given the sequential nature of the data, the posterior for ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z\\_{t} is poorly approximated when\nonly given access to xtsubscript𝑥𝑡x\\_{t}.\nThe samples capture\nthe effect of rotation but not the squares.\n\nAlthough the test log-likelihood was better for q-LR than for q-RNN, the samples obtained were worse off - in particular, they did not capture the three consecutive block structure.\nThe key difference between q-LR and q-RNN is the fact that the former has no memory that it carries across time. This facet will likely be more relevant\nin sequences where there are multiple patterns and the recognition network needs to remember the order in which the patters are generated.\n\nFinally, we note that both q-RNN and q-BRNN learn generative models with plausible samples.\n\n### Large Healing MNIST\n\nFigure [2(a)]In Figure 2 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") depicts pairs of training sequences, and the mean probabilities obtained\nafter reconstruction as learning progresses. There are instances (first and third from the top) where the noise level is too high for the\nstructure of the digit to be recognized from the training data alone.\nThe reconstructions also shows\nthat the model learns different styles of the digits (corresponding to variances within individual patients).\n\nFigure [2(b)]In Figure 2 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") depicts samples from the model under varying degrees of rotation (corresponding to the intensity of a treatment for example).\nHere again, the model shows that it is capable of learning variations within the digit as well as realizing the effect of an action and its intensity. This is a simple form of counterfactual reasoning that can be performed by the model, since none of the samples on display are within the training set.\n\nFigure [2(c)]In Figure 2 ‣ 6.1 Healing MNIST ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") answers two questions. The first is what happens when we ask the model to reconstruct on data that looks similar\nto the training distribution but not the same.\nThe input image is on the left (with a clean and noisy version of the digit displayed) and the following sample represent the reconstruction by the variational model of a sequence\ncreated from the input images. Following this, we forward sample from the model using the inferred latent representation under a constant action.\n\nTo this end, we consider digits of the same class (i.e. 1,5151,5) but of a different style than the model was trained on.\nThis idea has parallels within the medical setting where one asks about the course of action for a new patient.\nOn this unseen patient, the model would infer a latent state similar to a patient that exists in the training set.\nThis facet of the model motivates further investigation into the model’s capabilities as a metric for patient similarity.\nTo simulate the medical question: What would happen if the doctor prescribed the drug “rotate right mildly”? We forward sample\nfrom the model under this action.\n\nIn most cases, noisy or not, the patient’s reconstruction matches a close estimate of a digit found in the training set (close in log-likelihood since\nthis is the criterion the emission distribution was trained on). The final four rows depict scenarios in which the noise level is too high and\nwe don’t show the model enough sequences to make accurate inferences about the digit.\n\n### 6.2 Generative Models of Medical Data\n\n![Refer to caption](a) Test Log-Likelihood\n\n![Refer to caption](b)\n\n![Refer to caption](c)\n\nFigure 4: Results of disease progression\nmodeling for 8000 diabetic and pre-diabetic patients.

(b)\nProportion of patients inferred to have high (top\nquantile) glucose level with and without anti-diabetic\ndrugs, starting from the time of first Metformin\nprescription. (c) Proportion of patients inferred to have\nhigh (above 8%) A1c level with and without anti-diabetic\ndrugs, starting from the time of first Metformin\nprescription. Both (b) and (c) are created using the model trained with non-linear emission and transition functions.\n\nWe learn a generative model on healthcare claims data from a major health insurance provider. We look into the effect of anti-diabetic drugs on a population of 800080008000 diabetic and pre-diabetic patients.\n\nThe (binary) observations of interest here are: A1c level (hemoglobin A1c, a type of protein commonly used in the medical literature to indicate level of diabetes where high A1c level are an indicator for diabetes) and glucose (the amount of a patient’s blood sugar).\nWe bin glucose into quantiles and A1c into medically meaningful bins.\nThe observations also include age, gender and ICD-9 diagnosis codes depicting various comorbidities of diabetes such as congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and obesity.\n\nFor actions, we consider prescriptions of nine diabetic drugs including Metformin and Insulin, where Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line anti-diabetic drug. For each patient, we group their data over four and half years into\nthree months intervals.\n\nWe aim to assess the effect of anti-diabetic drugs on a patient’s A1c and glucose levels. To that end, we ask a counterfactual question: how would the patient’s A1c and glucose levels be had they not received the prescribed medications as observed in the dataset.\n\nA complication in trying to perform counterfactual inference for the A1c and glucose levels is that these quantities are not always measured for each patient at each time step. Moreover, patients who are suspected of being diabetic are tested much more often for their A1c and glucose levels, compared with healthy patients, creating a confounding factor, since diabetic patients tend to have higher A1c and glucose levels. To overcome this we add an observation variable called “lab indicator”, denoted xindsuperscript𝑥indx^{\\\\text{ind}}, which indicates whether the respective lab test, either A1c or glucose, was taken regardless of its outcome. We condition the time t𝑡t lab indicator observation, xtindsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡ind{x\\_{t}}^{\\\\text{ind}}, on the latent state ztsubscript𝑧𝑡z\\_{t}, and we condition the A1c and glucose value observations on both the latent state and the lab indicator observation. That way, once the model is trained we can perform counterfactual inference by using the _do_-operator on the lab indicator: setting it to 111 and ignoring its dependence on the latent state. See Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 6.2 Generative Models of Medical Data ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\") for an illustration of the model.\n\nWe train the model on a dataset of 800080008000 patients. We use q-BRNN as the recognition model.\n\nVariants of Kalman Filters:\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 6.2 Generative Models of Medical Data ‣ 6 Experimental Section ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\")(a) depicts the test log likelihood under variants of the graphical model depicted in Figure [1(b)]In Figure 1 ‣ 4 Model ‣ Deep Kalman Filters\"). Em(ission) denotes FκsubscriptF𝜅\\\\textit{F}\\_{\\\\kappa}, the emission function, and Tr(ansition) denotes GαsubscriptG𝛼\\\\textit{G}\\_{\\\\alpha}, the transition function of the mean.\nWe learn a fixed diagonal covariance matrix (SβsubscriptS𝛽\\\\textit{S}\\_{\\\\beta}). See Eq. (LABEL:eqn:gen\\_model)\nfor the role these quantities play in the generative model.\nLinear (L) denotes a linear relationship between entities,\nand Non-Linear (NL) denotes a non-linear one parameterized by a two-layer neural network. Early in training, a non-linear emission function suffices to achieve a high test log likelihood though as training progresses\nthe models with non-linear transition functions dominate.\n\nCounterfactual Inference:\nWe use a model with non-linear transition and non-linear emission functions.\nWe look at patients whose first prescribed anti-diabetic drug was Metformin, the most common first-line anti-diabetic drug, and who have at least six months of data before the first Metformin prescription. This leaves us with 800 patients for whom we ask the counterfactual question. For these patients, we infer the latent state up to the time t0subscript𝑡0t\\_{0} of first Metformin prescription. After t0subscript𝑡0t\\_{0} we perform forward sampling under two conditions: the “with” condition is using the patient’s true medication prescriptions; the “without” condition is removing the medication prescriptions, simulating a patient who receives no anti-diabetic medication. In both cases we set the lab indicator variable xtindsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡ind{x\\_{t}}^{\\\\text{ind}} to be 111, so we can observe the A1c and glucose lab values.

            "content": "The ability to learn and adapt rapidly from small data is essential to intelligence. However,\ncurrent success of deep learning relies greatly on big labeled data.\nIt learns each task in isolation and from scratch, by fitting a deep neural network over data\nthrough extensive, incremental model updates using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The approach is inherently data-hungry and time-consuming, with fundamental challenges for problems with limited data or in dynamic environments where fast adaptation is critical.\nIn contrast, humans can learn quickly from a few examples\nby leveraging prior experience. Such capacity in data efficiency and fast adaptation, if realized in machine learning, can greatly expand its utility. This motivates the study of few-shot learning, which aims to learn quickly from only a few examples \\[ [15])\\].\n\nSeveral existing ideas may be adapted for few-shot learning. In transfer learning, one often fine-tunes a pre-trained model using target data \\[ [22])\\], where it is challenging not to unlearn the previously acquired knowledge. In multi-task learning, the target task is trained jointly with auxiliary ones to distill inductive bias about the target problem \\[ [4])\\]. It is tricky to decide what to share in the joint model. In semi-supervised learning, one augments labeled target data with massive unlabeled data to leverage a holistic distribution of the data \\[ [28])\\]. Strong assumptions are required for this method to work. While these efforts can alleviate the issue of data scarcity to some extend, the way prior knowledge is used is specific and not generalizable. A principled approach for few-shot learning to representing, extracting and leveraging prior knowledge is in need.\n\nMeta-learning offers a new perspective to machine learning, by lifting the learning level from data to tasks  \\[ [20]), [3]), [24])\\]. Consider supervised learning. The common practice learns from a set of labeled examples, while meta-learning learns from a set of (labeled) tasks, each represented as a labeled training set and a labeled testing set. The hypothesis is that by being exposed to a broad scope of a task space, a learning agent may figure out a learning strategy tailored to the tasks in that space.\n\nSpecifically, in meta-learning, a learner for a specific task is learned by a learning algorithm called meta-learner, which is learned on a bunch of similar tasks to maximize the combined generalization power of the learners of all tasks. The learning occurs at two levels and in different time-scales. Gradual learning is performed across tasks, which learns a meta-learner to carry out rapid learning within each task, whose feedback is used to adjust the learning strategy of the meta-learner. Interestingly, the learning process can continue forever, thus enabling life-long learning, and at any moment, the meta-learner can be applied to learn a learner for any new task. Such a two-tiered learning to learn strategy for meta-learning has been applied successfully to few-shot learning on classification \\[ [19]), [25]), [18]), [7])\\], regression \\[ [19]), [7])\\], and reinforcement learning \\[ [26]), [6]), [7]), [17]), [23])\\].\n\nThe key in meta-learning is in the design of meta-learners to be learned. In general terms,\na meta-learner is a trainable learning algorithm that can train a learner,\ninfluence its behavior, or itself function as a learner.\nMeta-learners developed so far include recurrent models \\[ [10]), [19]), [26]), [6])\\], metrics \\[ [12]), [25])\\], or optimizers \\[ [2]), [16]), [18]), [7])\\].\nA recurrent model such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) \\[ [9])\\] processes data sequentially and figures out its own learning strategy from scratch in the course \\[ [19])\\]. Such meta-learners are versatile but less comprehensible, with applications in classification \\[ [19])\\], regression \\[ [10]), [19])\\], and reinforcement learning \\[ [26]), [6])\\].\nA metric influences a learner by modifying distances between examples. Such meta-learners are more suitable for non-parametric learners such as the k𝑘k-nearest neighbors algorithm or its variants \\[ [25]), [12])\\]. Meta-learners above do not learn an explicit learner, which is typically done by an optimizer such as SGD. This suggests that optimizers, if trainable, can serve as meta-learners. The meta-learner perspective of optimizers, which is used to be hand-designed, opens the door for learning optimizers via meta-learning.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Illustrating the two-level learning process of Meta-SGD. Gradual learning is performed across tasks at the meta-space (𝜽,𝜶)𝜽𝜶(\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}},\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}}) that learns the meta-learner. Rapid learning is carried out by the meta-learner in the learner space 𝜽𝜽\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} that learns task-specific learners.\n\nRecently, LSTM is used to update models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) iteratively like SGD \\[ [2]), [18])\\], where both initialization and update strategy are learned via meta-learning, thus called Meta-LSTM in what follows. This should be in sharp contrast to SGD where the initialization is randomly chosen, the learning rate is set manually, and the update direction simply follows the gradient. While Meta-LSTM shows promising results on few-shot learning \\[ [18])\\] or as a generic optimizer \\[ [2])\\], it is rather difficult to train. In practice, each parameter of the learner is updated independently in each step, which greatly limits its potential. In this paper, we develop a new optimizer that is very easy to train. Our proposed meta-learner acts like SGD, thus called Meta-SGD (Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\")), but the initialization, update direction, and learning rates are learned via meta-learning, like Meta-LSTM. Besides much easier to train than Meta-LSTM, Meta-SGD also learns much faster than Meta-LSTM. It can learn effectively from a few examples even in one step. Experimental results on regression, classification, and reinforcement learning unanimously show that Meta-SGD is highly competitive on few-show learning.",

Besides, while gradient is an effective direction for data fitting, it may lead to overfitting under the few-shot regime. This also makes it tricky to choose the learning rate. While many ideas may be applied for regularization, it remains challenging to balance between the induced prior and the few-shot fitting. What in need is a principled approach that determines all learning factors in a way that maximizes generalization power rather than data fitting. Another important aspect regards the speed of learning: can we learn within a couple of iterations? Besides an interesting topic on its own \\[ [14])\\], this will enable many emerging applications such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots that require to learn and react in a fast changing environment.\n\nThe idea of learning to learn appears to be promising for few-shot learning. Instead of hand-designing a learning algorithm for the task of interest, it learns from many related tasks how to learn, which may include how to initialize and update a learner, among others, by training a meta-learner to do the learning. The key here is in developing a high-capacity yet trainable meta-learner. While other meta-learners are possible, here we consider meta-learners in the form of optimizers, given their broad generality and huge success in machine learning. Specifically, we aim to learn an optimizer for few-shot learning.\n\nThere are three key ingredients in defining an optimizer: initialization, update direction, and learning rate. The initialization is often set randomly, the update direction often follows gradient or some variant (e.g., conjugate gradient), and the learning rate is usually set to be small, or decayed over iterations. While such rules of thumb work well with a huge amount of labeled data, they are unlikely reliable for few-shot learning. In this paper, we present a meta-learning approach that automatically determines all the ingredients of an optimizer in an end-to-end manner.\n\nMathematically, we propose the following meta-learner composed of an initialization term and an adaptation term:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝜽′=𝜽−𝜶∘∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽),superscript𝜽′𝜽𝜶∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\displaystyle\\\\bm{\\\\theta}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\bm{\\\\theta}-\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\\\circ\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}), |  | (2) |\n\nwhere 𝜽𝜽\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} and 𝜶𝜶\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}} are (meta-)parameters of the meta-learner to be learned, and ∘\\\\circ denotes element-wise product. Specifically, 𝜽𝜽\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} represents the state of a learner that can be used to initialize the learner for any new task, and 𝜶𝜶\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}} is a vector of the same size as 𝜽𝜽\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} that decides both the update direction and learning rate. The adaptation term 𝜶∘∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)𝜶∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\\\circ\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) is a vector whose direction represents the update direction and whose length represents the learning rate. Since the direction of 𝜶∘∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)𝜶∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\\\circ\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) is usually different from that of the gradient ∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}), it implies that the meta-learner does not follow the gradient direction to update the learner, as does by SGD. Interestingly, given 𝜶𝜶\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}}, the adaptation is indeed fully determined by the gradient, like SGD.\n\nIn summary, given a few examples 𝒯={(𝐱i,𝐲i)}𝒯subscript𝐱𝑖subscript𝐲𝑖\\\\mathcal{T}=\\\\{(\\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{i},\\\\operatorname{\\\\mathbf{y}}\\_{i})\\\\} for a few-shot learning problem, our meta-learner first initializes the learner with 𝜽𝜽\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}} and then adapts it to 𝜽′superscript𝜽′\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}}^{\\\\prime} in just one step, in a new direction 𝜶∘∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)𝜶∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\\\circ\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) different from the gradient ∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}) and using a learning rate implicitly implemented in 𝜶∘∇ℒ𝒯​(𝜽)𝜶∇subscriptℒ𝒯𝜽\\\\bm{\\\\alpha}\\\\circ\\\\nabla\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(\\\\bm{\\\\theta}). As our meta-learner also relies on the gradient as in SGD but it is learned via meta-learning rather than being hand-designed like SGD, we call it Meta-SGD.\n\n### 3.2 Meta-training\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Meta-training process of Meta-SGD.\n\nWe aim to train the meta-learner to perform well on many related tasks.

In contrast, Meta-SGD also learns the update direction and the learning rate, and may have a higher capacity. Meta-LSTM \\[ [18])\\] relies on LSTM to learn all initialization, update direction, and learning rate, like Meta-SGD, but it incurs a much higher complexity than Meta-SGD. In practice, it learns each parameter of the learner independently at each step, which may limit its potential.",

            "content": "We evaluate the proposed meta-learner Meta-SGD on a variety of few-shot learning problems on regression, classification, and reinforcement learning. We also compare its performance with the state-of-the-art results reported in previous work. Our results show that Meta-SGD can learn very quickly from a few examples with only one-step adaptation.\nAll experiments are run on Tensorflow \\[ [1])\\].\n\n### 4.1 Regression\n\nIn this experiment, we evaluate Meta-SGD on the problem of K𝐾K-shot regression, and compare it with the state-of-the-art meta-learner MAML \\[ [7])\\]. The target function is a sine curve y​(x)=A​sin⁡(ω​x+b)𝑦𝑥𝐴𝜔𝑥𝑏y(x)=A\\\\sin(\\\\omega x+b), where the amplitude A𝐴A, frequency ω𝜔\\\\omega, and phase b𝑏b follow the uniform distribution on intervals \\[0.1,5.0\\]0.15.0\\[0.1,5.0\\], \\[0.8,1.2\\]0.81.2\\[0.8,1.2\\], and \\[0,π\\]0𝜋\\[0,\\\\pi\\], respectively. The input range is restricted to the interval \\[−5.0,5.0\\]5.05.0\\[-5.0,5.0\\]. The K𝐾K-shot regression task is to estimate the underlying sine curve from only K𝐾K examples.\n\nFor meta-training, each task consists of K∈{5,10,20}𝐾51020K\\\\in\\\\{5,10,20\\\\} training examples and 10 testing examples with inputs randomly chosen from \\[−5.0,5.0\\]5.05.0\\[-5.0,5.0\\]. The prediction loss is measured by the mean squared error (MSE). For the regressor, we follow \\[ [7])\\] to use a small neural network with an input layer of size 1, followed by 2 hidden layers of size 40 with ReLU nonlinearities, and then an output layer of size 1. All weight matrices use truncated normal initialization with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01, and all bias vectors are initialized by 0. For Meta-SGD, all entries in 𝜶𝜶\\\\operatorname{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}} have the same initial value randomly chosen from \\[0.005,0.1\\]0.0050.1\\[0.005,0.1\\]. For MAML, a fixed learning rate α=0.01𝛼0.01\\\\alpha=0.01 is used following \\[ [7])\\]. Both meta-learners use one-step adaptation and are trained for 60000 iterations with meta batch-size of 4 tasks.\n\nFor performance evaluation (meta-testing), we randomly sample 100 sine curves. For each curve, we sample K𝐾K examples for training with inputs randomly chosen from \\[−5.0,5.0\\]5.05.0\\[-5.0,5.0\\], and another 100 examples for testing with inputs evenly distributed on \\[−5.0,5.0\\]5.05.0\\[-5.0,5.0\\].\nWe repeat this procedure 100 times and take the average of MSE. The results averaged over the sampled 100 sine curves with 95%percent9595\\\\% confidence intervals are summarized in Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\").\n\nBy Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\"), Meta-SGD performs consistently better than MAML on all cases with a wide margin, showing that Meta-SGD does have a higher capacity than MAML by learning all the initialization, update direction, and learning rate simultaneously, rather than just the initialization as in MAML. By learning all ingredients of an optimizer across many related tasks, Meta-SGD well captures the problem structure and is able to learn a learner with very few examples.\nIn contrast, MAML regards the learning rate α𝛼\\\\alpha as a hyper-parameter and just follows the gradient of empirical loss to learn the learner, which may greatly limit its capacity. Indeed, if we change the learning rate α𝛼\\\\alpha from 0.01 to 0.1, and re-train MAML via 5-shot meta-training, the prediction losses for 5-shot, 10-shot, and 20-shot meta-testing increase to 1.77±0.30plus-or-minus1.770.301.77\\\\pm 0.30, 1.37±0.23plus-or-minus1.370.231.37\\\\pm 0.23, and 1.15±0.20plus-or-minus1.150.201.15\\\\pm 0.20, respectively.\n\nFigure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") shows how the meta-learners perform on a random 5-shot regression task. From Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") (left), compared to MAML, Meta-SGD can adapt more quickly to the shape of the sine curve after just one step update with only 5 examples, even when these examples are all in one half of the input range. This shows that Meta-SGD well captures the meta-level information across all tasks. Moreover, it continues to improve with additional training examples during meta-tesing, as shown in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") (right). While the performance of MAML also gets better with more training examples, the regression results of Meta-SGD are still better than those of MAML (Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 4.1 Regression ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\")). This shows that our learned optimization strategy is better than gradient descent even when applied to solve the tasks with large training data.\n\nTable 1: Meta-SGD vs MAML on few-shot regression\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meta-training | Models | 5-shot testing | 10-shot testing | 20-shot testing |\n| 5-shot training | MAML | 1.13±0.18plus-or-minus1.130.181.13\\\\pm 0.18 | 0.85±0.14plus-or-minus0.850.140.85\\\\pm 0.14 | 0.71±0.12plus-or-minus0.710.120.71\\\\pm 0.12 |\n| Meta-SGD | 0.90±0.16plus-or-minus0.900.16\\\\mathbf{0.90\\\\pm 0.16} | 0.63±0.12plus-or-minus0.630.12\\\\mathbf{0.63\\\\pm 0.12} | 0.50±0.10plus-or-minus0.500.10\\\\mathbf{0.50\\\\pm 0.10} |\n| 10-shot training | MAML | 1.17±0.16plus-or-minus1.170.161.17\\\\pm 0.16 | 0.77±0.11plus-or-minus0.770.110.77\\\\pm 0.11 | 0.56±0.08plus-or-minus0.560.080.56\\\\pm 0.08 |\n| Meta-SGD | 0.88±0.14plus-or-minus0.880.14\\\\mathbf{0.88\\\\pm 0.14} | 0.53±0.09plus-or-minus0.530.09\\\\mathbf{0.53\\\\pm 0.09} | 0.35±0.06plus-or-minus0.350.06\\\\mathbf{0.35\\\\pm 0.06} |\n| 20-shot training | MAML | 1.29±0.20plus-or-minus1.290.201.29\\\\pm 0.20 | 0.76±0.12plus-or-minus0.760.120.76\\\\pm 0.12 | 0.48±0.08plus-or-minus0.480.080.48\\\\pm 0.08 |\n| Meta-SGD | 1.01±0.17plus-or-minus1.010.17\\\\mathbf{1.01\\\\pm 0.17} | 0.54±0.08plus-or-minus0.540.08\\\\mathbf{0.54\\\\pm 0.08} | 0.31±0.05plus-or-minus0.310.05\\\\mathbf{0.31\\\\pm 0.05} |\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 3: Left: Meta-SGD vs MAML on 5-shot regression. Both initialization (dotted) and result after one-step adaptation (solid) are shown. Right: Meta-SGD (10-shot meta-training) performs better with more training examples in meta-testing.\n\n### 4.2 Classification\n\nWe evaluate Meta-SGD on few-shot classification using two benchmark datasets Omniglot and MiniImagenet.\n\nOmniglot. The Omniglot dataset \\[ [13])\\] consists of 1623 characters from 50 alphabets. Each character contains 20 instances drawn by different individuals. We randomly select 1200 characters for meta-training, and use the remaining characters for meta-testing. We consider 5-way and 20-way classification for both 1 shot and 5 shots.\n\nMiniImagenet. The MiniImagenet dataset consists of 60000 color images from 100 classes, each with 600 images. The data is divided into three disjoint subsets: 64 classes for meta-training,\n16 classes for meta-validation, and 20 classes for meta-testing \\[ [18])\\]. We consider 5-way and 20-way classification for both 1 shot and 5 shots.\n\nWe train the model following \\[ [25])\\]. For an N𝑁N-way K𝐾K-shot classification task, we first sample N𝑁N classes from the meta-training dataset, and then in each class sample K𝐾K images for training and 151515 other images for testing. We update the meta-learner once for each batch of tasks. After meta-training, we test our model with unseen classes from the meta-testing dataset.\nFollowing \\[ [7])\\], we use a convolution architecture with 4 modules, where each module consists of 3×3333\\\\times 3 convolutions, followed by batch\nnormalization \\[ [11])\\], a ReLU nonlinearity, and 2×2222\\\\times 2 max-pooling.\nFor Omniglot, the images are downsampled to 28×28282828\\\\times 28, and we use 64 filters and add an additional fully-connected layer with dimensionality 32 after the convolution modules.\nFor MiniImagenet, the images are downsampled to 84×84848484\\\\times 84, and we use 32 filters in the convolution modules.\n\nWe train and evaluate Meta-SGD that adapts the learner in one step.\nIn each iteration of meta-training, Meta-SGD is updated once with one batch of tasks.\nWe follow \\[ [7])\\] for batch size settings. For Omniglot, the batch size is set to 32 and 16 for 5-way and 20-way classification, respectively. For MiniImagenet, the batch size is set to 4 and 2 for 1-shot and 5-shot classification, respectively. We add a regularization term to the objective function.\n\nTable 2: Classification accuracies on Omniglot\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 5-way Accuracy | 20-way Accuracy |\n| 1-shot | 5-shot | 1-shot | 5-shot |\n| Siamese Nets | 97.3%percent97.397.3\\\\% | 98.4%percent98.498.4\\\\% | 88.2%percent88.288.2\\\\% | 97.0%percent97.097.0\\\\% |\n| Matching Nets | 98.1%percent98.198.1\\\\% | 98.9%percent98.998.9\\\\% | 93.8%percent93.893.8\\\\% | 98.5%percent98.598.5\\\\% |\n| MAML | 98.7±0.4%plus-or-minus98.7percent0.498.7\\\\pm 0.4\\\\% | 99.9±0.1%plus-or-minus99.9percent0.199.9\\\\pm 0.1\\\\% | 95.8±0.3%plus-or-minus95.8percent0.395.8\\\\pm 0.3\\\\% | 98.9±0.2%plus-or-minus98.9percent0.298.9\\\\pm 0.2\\\\% |\n| Meta-SGD | 99.53±0.26%plus-or-minus99.53percent0.26\\\\mathbf{99.53\\\\pm 0.26\\\\%} | 99.93±0.09%plus-or-minus99.93percent0.09\\\\mathbf{99.93\\\\pm 0.09\\\\%} | 95.93±0.38%plus-or-minus95.93percent0.38\\\\mathbf{95.93\\\\pm 0.38\\\\%} | 98.97±0.19%plus-or-minus98.97percent0.19\\\\mathbf{98.97\\\\pm 0.19\\\\%} |\n\nTable 3: Classification accuracies on MiniImagenet\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 5-way Accuracy | 20-way Accuracy |\n| 1-shot | 5-shot | 1-shot | 5-shot |\n| Matching Nets | 43.56±0.84%plus-or-minus43.56percent0.8443.56\\\\pm 0.84\\\\% | 55.31±0.73%plus-or-minus55.31percent0.7355.31\\\\pm 0.73\\\\% | 17.31±0.22%plus-or-minus17.31percent0.2217.31\\\\pm 0.22\\\\% | 22.69±0.20%plus-or-minus22.69percent0.2022.69\\\\pm 0.20\\\\% |\n| Meta-LSTM | 43.44±0.77%plus-or-minus43.44percent0.7743.44\\\\pm 0.77\\\\% | 60.60±0.71%plus-or-minus60.60percent0.7160.60\\\\pm 0.71\\\\% | 16.70±0.23%plus-or-minus16.70percent0.2316.70\\\\pm 0.23\\\\% | 26.06±0.25%plus-or-minus26.06percent0.25{26.06\\\\pm 0.25\\\\%} |\n| MAML | 48.70±1.84%plus-or-minus48.70percent1.8448.70\\\\pm 1.84\\\\% | 63.11±0.92%plus-or-minus63.11percent0.9263.11\\\\pm 0.92\\\\% | 16.49±0.58%plus-or-minus16.49percent0.5816.49\\\\pm 0.58\\\\% | 19.29±0.29%plus-or-minus19.29percent0.2919.29\\\\pm 0.29\\\\% |\n| Meta-SGD | 50.47±1.87%plus-or-minus50.47percent1.87\\\\mathbf{50.47\\\\pm 1.87\\\\%} | 64.03±0.94%plus-or-minus64.03percent0.94\\\\mathbf{64.03\\\\pm 0.94\\\\%} | 17.56±0.64%plus-or-minus17.56percent0.64\\\\mathbf{17.56\\\\pm 0.64\\\\%} | 28.92±0.35%plus-or-minus28.92percent0.35\\\\mathbf{28.92\\\\pm 0.35\\\\%} |\n\nThe results of Meta-SGD are summarized in Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") and Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\"), together with results of other state-of-the-art models, including Siamese Nets \\[ [12])\\], Matching Nets \\[ [25])\\], Meta-LSTM \\[ [18])\\], and MAML \\[ [7])\\]. The results of previous models for 5-way and 20-way classification on Omniglot, and 5-way classification on MiniImagenet are reported in previous work \\[ [7])\\], while those for 20-way classification on MiniImagenet are obtained in our experiment. For the 20-way results on MiniImagenet, we run Matching Nets and Meta-LSTM using the implementation by \\[ [18])\\], and MAML using our own implementation111The code provided by \\[ [7])\\] does not scale for this 5-shot 20-way problem in one GPU with 12G memory used in our experiment..\nFor MAML, the learning rate α𝛼\\\\alpha is set to 0.01 as in the 5-way case, and the learner is updated with one gradient step for both meta-training and meta-testing tasks like Meta-SGD. All models are trained for 60000 iterations.\nThe results represent mean accuracies with 95%percent9595\\\\% confidence intervals over tasks.\n\nFor Omniglot, our model Meta-SGD is slightly better than the state-of-the-art models on all classification tasks.\nIn our experiments we noted that for 5-shot classification tasks, the model performs better when it is trained with 1-shot tasks during meta-training than trained with 5-shot tasks. This phenomenon was observed in both 5-way and 20-way classification. The 5-shot (meta-testing) results of Meta-SGD in Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 4.2 Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") are obtained via 1-shot meta-training.\n\nFor MiniImagenet, Meta-SGD outperforms all other models in all cases. Note that Meta-SGD learns the learner in just one step, making it faster to train the model and to adapt to new tasks, while still improving accuracies. In comparison, previous models often update the learner using SGD with multiple gradient steps or using LSTM with multiple iterations.\nFor 20-way classification, the results of Matching Nets shown in Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 4.2 Classification ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") are obtained when the model is trained with 10-way classification tasks. When trained with 20-way classification tasks, its accuracies drop to 12.27±0.18plus-or-minus12.270.1812.27\\\\pm 0.18 and 21.30±0.21plus-or-minus21.300.2121.30\\\\pm 0.21 for 1-shot and 5-shot, respectively, suggesting that Matching Nets may need more iterations for sufficient training, especially for 1-shot.\nWe also note that for 20-way classification, MAML with the learner updated in one gradient step performs worse than Matching Nets and Meta-LSTM. In comparison, Meta-SGD has the highest accuracies for both 1-shot and 5-shot.\nWe also run experiments on MAML for 5-way classification where the learner is updated with 1 gradient step for both meta-training and meta-testing, the mean accuracies of which are 44.40%percent44.4044.40\\\\% and 61.11%percent61.1161.11\\\\% for 1-shot and 5-shot classification, respectively.\nThese results show the capacity of Meta-SGD in terms of learning speed and performance for few-shot classification.\n\n### 4.3 Reinforcement Learning\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 4: Left: Meta-SGD vs MAML on a 2D navigation task with fixed start position and randomly sampled goal position. Right: Meta-SGD vs MAML on a 2D navigation task with randomly sampled start and goal positions.\n\nIn this experiment, we evaluate Meta-SGD on 2D navigation tasks, and compare it with MAML \\[ [7])\\]. The purpose of this reinforcement learning experiment is to enable a point agent in 2D to quickly acquire a policy for the task where the agent should move from a start position to a goal position. We experiment with two sets of tasks separately. In the first set of tasks, proposed by MAML, we fix the start position, which is the origin (0,0)00(0,0), and randomly choose a goal position from the unit square \\[−0.5,0.5\\]×\\[−0.5,0.5\\]0.50.50.50.5\\[-0.5,0.5\\]\\\\times\\[-0.5,0.5\\] for each task. In the second set of tasks, both of the start and goal positions are randomly chosen from the unit square \\[−0.5,0.5\\]×\\[−0.5,0.5\\]0.50.50.50.5\\[-0.5,0.5\\]\\\\times\\[-0.5,0.5\\].\n\nGiven a task, the state is the position of the agent in the 2D plane and the action is the velocity of the agent in the next step (unit time). The new state after the agent’s taking the action is the sum of the previous state and the action. The action is sampled from a Gaussian distribution produced by a policy network, which takes the current state as input and outputs the mean and log variance of the Gaussian distribution. For the policy network, we follow \\[ [7])\\]. The mean vector is created from the state via a small neural network consisting of an input layer of size 2, followed by 2 hidden layers of size 100 with ReLU nonlinearities, and then an output layer of size 2. The log variance is a diagonal matrix with two trainable parameters. For the agent to move to the goal position, we define the reward as the negative distance between the state and the goal.\n\nFor meta-training, we sample 20 tasks as a mini-batch in each iteration. We first sample 20 trajectories per task according to the policy network and each trajectory terminates when the agent is within 0.01 of the goal or at the step of 100.

We take 100 iterations in total.\n\nFor meta-testing, we randomly sample 600 tasks. For each task, we sample 20 trajectories according to the policy network initialized by the meta-learner, and then update the policy network by the vanilla policy gradient and the meta-learner. To evaluate the performance of the updated policy network on this task, 20 new trajectories are sampled and we calculate the return, the sum of the rewards, for each trajectory and take average over these returns as the average return for this task. The results averaged over the sampled 600 tasks with 95%percent9595\\\\% confidence intervals are summarized in Table [4]Table 4 ‣ 4.3 Reinforcement Learning ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\"), which show that Meta-SGD has relatively higher returns than MAML on both sets of tasks.\n\nTable 4: Meta-SGD vs MAML on 2D navigation\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | fixed start position | varying start position |\n| MAML | −9.12±0.66plus-or-minus9.120.66-9.12\\\\pm 0.66 | −10.71±0.76plus-or-minus10.710.76-10.71\\\\pm 0.76 |\n| Meta-SGD | −8.64±0.68plus-or-minus8.640.68\\\\mathbf{-8.64\\\\pm 0.68} | −10.15±0.62plus-or-minus10.150.62\\\\mathbf{-10.15\\\\pm 0.62} |\n\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.3 Reinforcement Learning ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Meta-SGD: Learning to Learn Quickly for Few-Shot Learning\") shows some qualitative results of Meta-SGD and MAML. For the set of tasks with fixed start position, the initialized policies with Meta-SGD and MAML perform quite similar – the agents walk around near the start position. After one step update of the policies, both of the agents move to the goal position, and the agent guided by Meta-SGD has a stronger perception of the target. For the set of tasks with different start positions, the initialized policies with Meta-SGD and MAML both lead the agents to the origin.

            "content": "We have developed a new, easily trainable, SGD-like meta-learner Meta-SGD that can learn faster and more accurately than existing meta-learners for few-shot learning. We learn all ingredients of an optimizer, namely initialization, update direction, and learning rate, via meta-learning in an end-to-end manner, resulting in a meta-learner with a higher capacity compared to other optimizer-like meta-learners. Remarkably, in just one step adaptation, Meta-SGD leads to new state-of-the-art results on few-shot regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.\n\nOne important future work is large-scale meta-learning. As training a meta-learner involves training a large number of learners, this entails a far more computational demand than traditional learning approaches, especially if a big learner is necessary when the data for each task increases far beyond “few shots”. Another important problem regards the versatility or generalization capacity of meta-learner, including dealing with unseen situations such as new problem setups or new task domains, or even multi-tasking meta-learners.

            "content": "The computational neuroscience community is increasingly relying on deep learning both to directly model large-scale neural recordings \\[ [1]), [2]), [3])\\] as well to train neural networks on computational tasks and compare the internal dynamics of such trained networks to measured neural recordings \\[ [4]), [5]), [6]), [7]), [8]), [9])\\]. For example, several recent studies have reported similarities between the internal representations of biological and artificial networks \\[ [5]), [10]), [11]), [12]), [13]), [14]), [15]), [16])\\]. These representational similarities are quite striking since artificial neural networks clearly differ in many ways from their much more biophysically complex natural counterparts. How then, should we scientifically interpret the striking representational similarity of biological and artificial networks, despite their vast disparity in biophysical and architectural mechanisms?\n\nA fundamental impediment to achieving any such clear scientific interpretation lies in the fact that infinitely many model networks may be consistent with any particular computational task or neural recording. Indeed, many modern applications of deep learning utilize a wide variety of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures \\[ [17]), [18]), [19]), [20])\\], initialization strategies \\[ [21])\\] and regularization terms \\[ [22]), [23])\\]. Moreover, new architectures continually emerge through large-scale automated searches \\[ [24]), [25]), [26])\\]. This dizzying set of modelling degrees of freedom in deep learning raises fundamental questions about how the degree of match between dynamical properties of biological and artificial networks varies across different modelling choices used to generate RNNs.\n\nFor example, do certain properties of RNN dynamics vary widely across individual architectures? If so, then a high degree of match between these properties measured in both an artificial RNN and a biological circuit might yield insights into the architecture underlying the biological circuit’s dynamics, as well as rule out other potential architectures. Alternatively, are other properties of RNN dynamics universal across many architectural classes and other modelling degrees of freedom? If so, such properties are interesting neural invariants determined primarily by the task, and we should naturally expect them to recur not only across diverse classes of artificial RNNs, but also in relevant brain circuits that solve the same task. The existence of such universal properties would then provide a satisfying explanation of certain aspects of the match in internal representations between biological and artificial RNNs, despite many disparities in their underlying mechanisms.\n\nInterestingly, such universal properties can also break the vast design space of RNNs into different universality classes, with these universal dynamical properties being constant within classes, and varying only between classes. This offers the possibility of theoretically calculating or understanding such universal properties by analyzing the simplest network within each universality class111This situation is akin to that in equilibrium statistical mechanics in which physical materials as disparate as water and ferromagnets have identical critical exponents at second order phase transitions, by virtue of the fact that they fall within the same universality class \\[ [27])\\]. Moreover, these universal critical exponents can be computed theoretically in the simplest model within this class: the Ising model.. Thus a foundational question in the theory of RNNs, as well as in their application to neuroscientific modelling, lies in ascertaining which aspects of RNN dynamics vary across different architectural choices, and which aspects—if any—are universal across such choices.\n\nTheoretical clarity on the nature of individuality and universality in nonlinear RNN dynamics is largely lacking222Although Feigenbaum’s analysis \\[ [28])\\] of period doubling in certain 1D maps might be viewed as an analysis of 1D RNNs., with some exceptions \\[ [29]), [30]), [31]), [32])\\]. Therefore, with the above neuroscientific and theoretical motivations in mind, we initiate an extensive numerical study of the variations in RNN dynamics across thousands of RNNs with varying modelling choices. We focus on canonical neuroscientifically motivated tasks that exemplify basic elements of neural computation, including the storage and maintenance of multiple discrete memories, the production of oscillatory motor-like dynamics, and contextual integration in the face of noisy evidence \\[ [33]), [4])\\].\n\nTo compare internal representations across networks, we focused on comparing the geometry of neural dynamics using common network similarity measures such as singular vector canonical correlation analysis (SVCCA) \\[ [34])\\] and centered kernel alignment (CKA) \\[ [35])\\]. We also used tools from dynamical systems analysis to extract more topological aspects of neural dynamics, including fixed points, limit cycles, and transition pathways between them, as well as the linearized dynamics around fixed points \\[ [33])\\]. We focused on these approaches because comparisons between artificial and biological network dynamics at the level of geometry, and topology and linearized dynamics, are often employed in computational neuroscience.\n\nUsing these tools, we find that different RNN architectures trained on the same task exhibit both universal and individualistic dynamical properties. In particular, we find that the geometry of neural representations varies considerably across RNNs with different nonlinearities. We also find surprising dissociations between dynamical similarity and functional similarity, whereby trained and untrained architectures of a given type can be more similar to each other than trained architectures of different types. This yields a cautionary tale for using SVCCA or CKA to compare neural geometry, as these similarity metrics may be more sensitive to particular modeling choices than to overall task performance. Finally, we find considerably more universality across architectures in the topological structure of fixed points, limit cycles, and specific properties of the linearized dynamics about fixed points. Thus overall, our numerical study provides a much needed foundation for understanding universality and individuality in network dynamics across various RNN models, a question that is both of intrinsic theoretical interest, and of importance in neuroscientific applications.",

We studied 4 RNN architectures, the vanilla RNN (Vanilla), the Update-Gate RNN (UGRNN; \\[ [20])\\]), the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU; \\[ [18])\\]), and the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM; \\[ [17])\\]). The equations for these RNNs can be found in Appendix [A]Appendix A RNN Architectures ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\"). For each RNN architecture we modified the (non-gate) point-wise activation function to be either rectified linear (relu) or hyperbolic tangent (tanh). The point-wise activation for the gating units is kept as a sigmoid.\n\nWe trained networks for every combination of the following parameters: RNN architecture (Vanilla, UGRNN, LSTM, GRU), activation (relu, tanh), number of units/neurons (64, 128, 256), and L2 regularization (1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2). This yielded 4×2×3×442344\\\\times 2\\\\times 3\\\\times 4 = 96 unique configurations. For each one of these configurations, we performed a separate random hyperparameter search over gradient clipping values \\[ [22])\\] (logarithmically spaced from 0.1 to 10) and the learning rate schedule parameters. The learning rate schedule is an exponentially decaying schedule parameterized by the initial rate (with search range from 1e-5 to 0.1), decay rate (0.1 to 0.9), and momentum (0 to 1). All networks were trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum \\[ [36]), [37])\\] for 20,000 iterations with a batch size of 64. For each network configuration, we selected the best hyperparameters using a validation set. We additionally trained each of these configurations with 30 random seeds, yielding 2,880 total networks for analysis for each task. All networks achieve low error; histograms of the final loss values achieved by all networks are available in Appendix [C]Appendix C Network performance ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\").\n\n### 2.2 Tasks\n\nWe used three canonical tasks that have been previously studied in the neuroscience literature:\n\n##### K𝐾K-bit flip-flop\n\nFollowing \\[ [33])\\], RNNs were provided K𝐾K inputs taking discrete values in {−1,0,+1}101\\\\{-1,0,+1\\\\}. The RNN has K𝐾K outputs, each of which is trained to remember the last non-zero input on its corresponding input. Here we set K=3𝐾3K=3, so e.g. output 2 remembers the last non-zero state of input 2 (+1 or -1), but ignores inputs 1 and 3. We set the number of time steps, T𝑇T, to 100, and the flip probability (the probability of any input flipping on a particular time step) to 5%.\n\n##### Frequency-cued sine wave\n\nFollowing \\[ [33])\\], RNNs received a static input, x∼Uniform​(0,1)similar-to𝑥Uniform01x\\\\sim\\\\text{Uniform}(0,1), and were trained to produce a unit amplitude sine wave, sin⁡(2​π​ω​t)2𝜋𝜔𝑡\\\\sin(2\\\\pi\\\\omega t), whose frequency is proportional to the input: ω=0.04​x+0.01𝜔0.04𝑥0.01\\\\omega=0.04x+0.01. We set T=500𝑇500T=500 and d​t=0.01𝑑𝑡0.01dt=0.01 (5 simulated seconds total).\n\n##### Context-dependent integration (CDI)\n\nFollowing previous work \\[ [4])\\], RNNs were provided with K𝐾K static context inputs and K𝐾K time-varying white noise input streams. On each trial, all but one context input was zero, thus forming a one-hot encoding indicating which noisy input stream of length T𝑇T should be integrated. The white noise input was sampled from 𝒩​(μ,1)𝒩𝜇1\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mu,1) at each time step, with μ𝜇\\\\mu sampled uniformly between -1 and 1 and kept static across time for each trial. RNNs were trained to report the cumulative sum of the cued white-noise input stream across time. Here, we set K=2𝐾2K=2 and T=30𝑇30T=30.\n\n### 2.3 Assessing model similarity\n\nThe central questions we examined were: how similar are the representations and dynamics of different RNNs trained on the same task? To address this, we use approaches that highlight different but sometimes overlapping aspects of RNN function:\n\n##### SVCCA and CKA to assess representational geometry\n\nWe quantified similarity at the level of representational geometry\\[ [38])\\]. In essence, this means quantifying whether the responses of two RNNs to the same inputs are well-aligned by some kind of linear transformation.\n\nWe focused on singular vector canonical correlations analysis (SVCCA; \\[ [34])\\]), which has found traction in both neuroscience \\[ [12])\\] and machine learning communities \\[ [39]), [15])\\]. SVCCA compares representations in two steps. First, each representation is projected onto their top principal components to remove the effect of noisy (low variance) directions. Typically, the number of components is chosen to retain ~95% of the variance in the representation. Then, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is performed to find a linear transformation that maximally correlates the two representations. This yields R𝑅R correlation coefficients, 1≥ρ1≥…≥ρR≥01subscript𝜌1…subscript𝜌𝑅01\\\\geq\\\\rho\\_{1}\\\\geq\\\\ldots\\\\geq\\\\rho\\_{R}\\\\geq 0, providing a means to compare the two datasets, typically by averaging or summing the coefficients (see Appendix [D]Appendix D SVCCA ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") for further details).\n\nIn addition to SVCCA, we explored a related metric, centered kernel alignment (CKA; \\[ [35])\\]). CKA is related to SVCCA in that it also suppresses low variance directions, however CKA weights the components proportional to the singular value (as opposed to removing some completely). We found that using SVCCA and CKA yielded similar results for the purposes of determining whether representations cluster by architecture or activation function so we present SVCCA results in the main text but provide a comparison with CKA in Appendix [E]Appendix E Centered kernel alignment (CKA) ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\").\n\n##### Fixed point topology to assess computation\n\nAn alternative perspective to representational geometry for understanding computation in RNNs is dynamics. We studied RNN dynamics by reducing their nonlinear dynamics to linear approximations. Briefly, this approach starts by optimizing to find the fixed points {𝐡1∗,𝐡2∗,…}subscriptsuperscript𝐡1subscriptsuperscript𝐡2…\\\\{\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*}\\_{1},\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*}\\_{2},...\\\\} of an RNN such that 𝐡i∗≈F​(𝐡i∗,𝐱∗)superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑖𝐹superscriptsubscript𝐡𝑖superscript𝐱\\\\mathbf{h}\\_{i}^{\\*}\\\\approx F(\\\\mathbf{h}\\_{i}^{\\*},\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*}). We use the term fixed point to also include approximate fixed points, which are not truly fixed but are nevertheless very slow on the time scale of the task.\n\nWe set the input (𝐱∗superscript𝐱\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*}) to be static when finding fixed points. These inputs can be thought of as specifying different task conditions. In particular, the static command frequency in the sine wave task and the hot-one context signal in the CDI task are examples of such condition specifying inputs. Note however, that dimensions of 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x} that are time-varying are set to 𝟎0\\\\boldsymbol{0} in 𝐱∗superscript𝐱\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*}. In particular, the dimensions of the input that represent the input pulses in the 333-bit memory task and the white noise input streams in the CDI task are set to 𝟎0\\\\boldsymbol{0} in 𝐱∗superscript𝐱\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*}.\n\nNumerical procedures for identifying fixed points are discussed in \\[ [33]), [40])\\].\nAround each fixed point, the local behavior of the system can be approximated by a reduced system with linear dynamics:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝐡t≈𝐡∗+𝐉​(𝐡∗,𝐱∗)​(𝐡t−1−𝐡∗),subscript𝐡𝑡superscript𝐡𝐉superscript𝐡superscript𝐱subscript𝐡𝑡1superscript𝐡\\\\mathbf{h}\\_{t}\\\\approx\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*}+\\\\mathbf{J}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*},\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*})\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{h}\\_{t-1}-\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*}\\\\right), |  |\n\nwhere 𝐉i​j​(𝐡∗,𝐱∗)=∂Fi​(𝐡∗,𝐱∗)∂hj∗subscript𝐉𝑖𝑗superscript𝐡superscript𝐱subscript𝐹𝑖superscript𝐡superscript𝐱subscriptsuperscriptℎ𝑗\\\\mathbf{J}\\_{ij}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*},\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*})=\\\\frac{\\\\partial F\\_{i}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{\\*},\\\\mathbf{x}^{\\*})}{\\\\partial h^{\\*}\\_{j}} denotes the Jacobian of the RNN update rule. We studied these linearized systems using the eigenvector decomposition for non-normal matrices (see Appendix [B]Appendix B Non-normal linear dynamical systems analysis ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") for the eigenvector decomposition). In this analysis, both the topology of the fixed points and the linearizations around those fixed points become objects of interest.\n\n##### Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling\n\nFor each analysis, we computed network similarity between all pairs of network configurations for a given task, yielding a large (dis-)similarity matrix for each task (for example, we show this distance matrix for the flip-flop task in Fig. [1]Figure 1 ‣ Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c). To visualize the structure in these matrices, we used multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) \\[ [41])\\] to generate a 2D projection which we used for visualization (Fig. [1]Figure 1 ‣ Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") d and f, Fig. [2]Figure 2 ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c and e, Fig. [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c and d). For visualization purposes, we separate plots colored by RNN architecture (for a fixed nonlinearity, tanh) and nonlinearity (for a fixed architecture, Vanilla).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: 3-bit discrete memory. a) Inputs (black) of -1 or 1 come in at random times while the corresponding output (dashed red) has to remember the last non-zero state of the input (either +1 or -1). b) Example PCA trajectories of dynamics for an example architecture and activation function. c) Dynamics across networks are compared via SVCCA and given a distance (one minus the average correlation coefficient), yielding a network-network distance matrix. d) This distance matrix is used to create a 2D embedding via multidimensional scaling (MDS) of all networks, showing clustering based on RNN architecture (left) and activation function (right). e) Topological analysis of a network using fixed points. First, the fixed points of a network’s dynamics are found, and their linear stability is assessed (left, black dots - stable fixed points, red - one unstable dimension, green - 2 unstable dimensions, blue - 3 unstable dimensions. By studying heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits, the fixed point structure is translated to a graph representation (right). f) This graph representation is then compared across networks, creating another network-network distance matrix. The distance matrix is used to embed the network comparisons into 2D space using MDS, showing that the topological representation of a network using fixed point structure is more similar across architectures (left) and activation functions (right) than the geometry of the network is (layout as in 1d).",

Finally, we highlight a case where SVCCA is not necessarily indicative of functional similarity (Fig. 4).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Sine wave generation. a) Schematic showing conversion of static input specifying a command frequency, ω𝜔\\\\omega, for the sine wave output sin⁡(2​π​ω​t)2𝜋𝜔𝑡\\\\sin(2\\\\pi\\\\omega t). b) PCA plots showing trajectories using many evenly divided command frequencies delivered one at a time (blue: smallest ω𝜔\\\\omega, yellow: largest ω𝜔\\\\omega). c) MDS plots based on SVCCA network-network distances, layout as in Fig. 1d. d) Left, fixed points (colored circles, with color indicating ω𝜔\\\\omega, one fixed point per command frequency) showing a single fixed point in the middle of each oscillatory trajectory.

Across all network architectures the resulting trajectories roughly trace out the corners of a three-dimensional cube. While these example trajectories look qualitatively similar across architectures, SVCCA revealed systematic differences. This is visible in the raw SVCCA distance matrix ( [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c), as well as in low-dimensional linear embeddings achieved by applying multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ( [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") d) created using the SVCCA distance matrix.\n\nTo study the dynamics of these networks, we ran an optimization procedure \\[ [40])\\] to numerically identify fixed points for each trained network (see Methods). A representative network is shown in [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e (left). The network solves the task by encoding all 23superscript232^{3} possible outputs as 8 stable fixed points. Furthermore, there are saddle points with one, two, or three unstable dimensions (see caption), which route the network activity towards the appropriate stable fixed point for a given input.\n\nWe devised an automated procedure to quantify the computational logic of the fixed point structure in [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e that effectively ignored the precise details in the transient dynamics and overall geometry of the 3D cube evident in the PCA trajectories. Specifically, we distilled the dynamical trajectories into a directed graph, with nodes representing fixed points, and weighted edges representing the probability of moving from one fixed point to another when starting the initial state a small distance away from the first fixed point. We did this 100 times for each fixed point, yielding a probability of transitioning from one fixed point to another. As expected, stable fixed points have no outgoing edges, and only have a self-loop. All unstable fixed points had two or more outgoing edges, which are directed at nearby stable fixed points. We constructed a fixed point graph for each network and used the Euclidean distance between the graph connectivity matrices to quantify dis-similarity333While determining whether two graphs are isomorphic is a challenging problem in general, we circumvented this issue by lexographically ordering the fixed points based on the RNN readout. Networks with different numbers of fixed points than the modal number were discarded (less than 10% of the population).. These heteroclinic orbits are shown in [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e, light black trajectories from one fixed point to another. Using this topological measure of RNN similarity, we find that all architectures converge to very similar solutions as shown by an MDS embedding of the fixed point graph ( [Fig.1]In Visualizing similarity with multi-dimensional scaling ‣ 2.3 Assessing model similarity ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") f).\n\n### 3.2 Sine wave generation\n\nWe trained RNNs to convert a static input into a sine wave, e.g. convert the command frequency ω𝜔\\\\omega to sin⁡(2​π​ω​t)2𝜋𝜔𝑡\\\\sin(2\\\\pi\\\\omega t) ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") a). [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") b shows low-dimensional trajectories in trained networks across all architectures and nonlinearities (LSTM with ReLU did not train effectively, so we excluded it). Each trajectory is colored by the input frequency.\nFurthermore, all trajectories followed a similar pattern: oscillations occur in a roughly 2D subspace (circular trajectories), with separate circles for each frequency input separated by a third dimension. We then performed an analogous series of analyses to those used in the previous task. In particular, we computed the SVCCA distances (raw distances not shown) and used those to create an embedding of the network activity ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c) as a function of either RNN architecture or activation. These SVCCA MDS summaries show systematic differences in the representations across both architecture and activation.\n\nMoving to the analysis of dynamics, we found for each input frequency a single input-dependent fixed point ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") d, left). We studied the linearized dynamics around each fixed point and found a single pair of imaginary eigenvalues, representing a mildly unstable oscillatory mode whose complex angle aligned well with the input frequency ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") d, right). We compared the frequency of the linear model to the input frequency and found generally good alignment. We averaged the linear frequency across all networks within architecture or activation and found small, but systematic differences ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") f). Embeddings of the topological structure of the input-dependent fixed points did not reveal any structure that systematically varied by architecture or activation ( [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Context-Dependent Integration. a) One of two streams of white-noise input (blue or red) is contextually selected by a one-hot static context input to be integrated as output of the network, while the other is ignored (blue or red). b) The trained networks were studied with probe inputs (panel inset in a), probes from blue to red show probe input).

In order to study the the dimensionality of the solution to integration, we systematically removed the modes with smallest eigenvalues one at a time, and recomputed the prediction of the new linear system for the unit magnitude input. These plots indicate that the vanilla RNN (blue) uses a single mode to perform the integration, while the gated architectures distribute this across a larger number of linear modes.\n\n### 3.3 Context-dependent integration (analog memory)\n\nWe trained an RNN to contextually integrate one of two white noise input streams, while ignoring the other ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") a). We then studied the network representations by delivering a set of probe inputs ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") a). The 3D PCA plots are shown in [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") b, showing obvious differences in representational geometry as a function of architecture and activation. The MDS summary plot of the SVCCA distances of the representations is shown in [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") c, again showing systematic clustering as a function of architecture (left) and activation (right). We also analyzed the topology of the fixed points (black dots in [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") b) to assess how well the fixed points approximated a line attractor. We quantified this by generating a graph with edges between fixed points that were nearest neighbors. This resulted in a graph for each line attractor in each context, which we then compared using Euclidean distance and embedded in a 2D space using MDS ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") d). The MDS summary plot did not cluster strongly by architecture, but did cluster based on activation.\n\nWe then studied the linearized dynamics around each fixed point ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e,f). We focused on a single context, and studied how a unit magnitude relevant input (as opposed to the input that should be contextually ignored) was integrated by the linear system around the nearest fixed point. This was previously studied in depth in \\[ [4])\\]. Here we were interested in differences in integration strategy as a function of architecture. We found similar results to \\[ [4])\\] for the vanilla RNN, which integrated the input using a single linear mode with an eigenvalue of 1, with input coming in on the associated left eigenvector and represented on the associated right eigenvector. Examination of all linearized dynamics averaged over all fixed points within the context showed that different architectures had a similar strategy, except that the gated architectures had many more eigenvalues near 1 ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") e) and thus used a high-dimensional strategy to accomplish the same goal as the vanilla RNN does in 1 dimension. We further studied the dimensionality by systematically zeroing out eigenvalues from smallest to largest to discover how many linear modes were necessary to integrate a unit magnitude input, compared to the full linear approximation ( [Fig.3]In 3.2 Sine wave generation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") f). These results show that all of the networks and architectures use essentially the same integration strategy, but systematically vary by architecture in terms of the number of modes they employ. To a lesser degree they also vary some in the amount the higher order terms contribute to the solution, as shown by the differences away from an integral of 1 for a unit magnitude input, for the full linearized system with no modes zeroed out (analogous to [Fig.2]In 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") f).\n\nFinally, to highlight the difficulty of using CCA-based techniques to compare representational geometry in simple tasks, we used the inputs of the context-dependent integrator task to drive both trained and untrained vanilla RNNs ( [Fig.4]In 3.3 Context-dependent integration (analog memory) ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\")). We found that the average canonical correlation between trained and untrained networks can be larger than between trained RNNs with different nonlinearities. The summary MDS plot across many RNNs shows that the two clusters of untrained and trained relu networks are closer together than the two clusters of trained tanh networks [Fig.4]In 3.3 Context-dependent integration (analog memory) ‣ 3 Results ‣ Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks\") b.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: An example where SVCCA yields a stronger correlation between untrained networks and trained networks than between trained networks with different nonlinearities. a) An example (single context shown) of the representation of the probe inputs (blue through red) for four networks: two trained, and two untrained with tanh and ReLU nonlinearities. In this case the untrained tanh and ReLU networks have a higher correlation to the trained tanh network than the trained tanh network does to the trained ReLU network. b) MDS plot of SVCCA-based distances for many trained and untrained networks, showing that trained and untrained relu networks are more similar to each other on average than to tanh networks.",

            "content": "In this work we empirically study aspects of individuality and universality in recurrent networks. We find individuality in that representational geometry of RNNs varies significantly as a function of architecture and activation function (Fig. 1d, 2c, 3c). We also see hints of universality: the fixed point topologies show far less variation across networks than the representations do (Fig. 1f, 2e, 3d). Linear analyses also showed similar solutions, e.g. essentially linear oscillations for the sine wave task (Fig. 2f) and linear integration in the CDI task (Fig. 3f). However, linear analyses also showed variation across architectures in the dimensionality of the solution to integration (Fig. 3e).\n\nWhile the linear analyses showed common computational strategies across all architectures (such as a slightly unstable oscillation in the linearized system around each fixed point), we did see small systematic differences that clustered by architecture (such as the difference between input frequency and frequency of oscillatory mode in the linearized system). This indicates that another aspect of individuality appears to be the degree to which higher order terms contribute to the total solution.\n\nThe fixed point analysis discussed here has one major limitation, namely that the number of fixed points must be the same across networks that are being compared. For the three tasks studied here, we found that the vast majority of trained networks did indeed have the same number of fixed points for each task. However, an important direction for future work is extending the analysis to be more robust with respect to differing numbers of fixed points.\n\nIn summary, we hope this empirical study begins a larger effort to characterize methods for comparing RNN dynamics, building a foundation for future connections of biological circuits and artificial neural networks.\n\n#### Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jeffrey Pennington, Maithra Raghu, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, and Larry Abbott for helpful feedback and discussions.

            "content": "A large body of work has shown that computations in the brain — implemented by the collective dynamics of large populations of neurons — can be modeled with recurrent artificial neural networks (RNNs) \\[ [48]), [61]), [76]), [60]), [35]), [80]), [10]), [58]), [71]), [45]), [70]), [3]), [8]), [69])\\]. Along these lines, many investigations of the mechanisms underlying computations in the brain have been performed by training RNNs on tasks inspired by neuroscience experiments. In particular, recent studies \\[ [20]), [76])\\] have proposed ways in which RNNs could learn multiple tasks while reusing parameters like biological agents do. However, in all of them, models start with no pre-existing knowledge about the world and need to learn all the shared parameters incrementally by seeing each task, one by one. Notably, this scenario, often studied in deep learning under continual learning, is not exactly one in which biological agents usually operate.\n\nIndeed, when faced with a new task, animals have access to varying amounts of pre-existing inductive biases acquired over large timescales : evolutionary \\[ [17]), [61])\\] as well as those within their lifetime \\[ [6]), [73])\\]. These biases are assumptions about the solution of future tasks based on heredity or experience : something really useful for biological agents who often inhabit particular ecological niches \\[ [9])\\] where a substantial structure is shared between tasks. In this work, we explore how the common statistics of a corpus of tasks — standing in for the knowledge acquired through long timescales — could be encoded into an RNN in a biologically inspired way, and then leveraged to enable learning multiple tasks sequentially more efficiently than in traditional continual learning scenarios.\n\nOne way in which inductive biases can be expressed in the brain is in terms of neural architecture or structure\\[ [61])\\]. Neural networks in the brain may come with a pre-configured wiring diagram, encoded in the genome \\[ [79])\\]. Such structural pre-configurations can put useful constraints on the learning problem by forcing the representations to have a desirable structure. For example, a neural network made up of different specialized modules encourages the learning of independent and reusable knowledge, which leads to better generalization \\[ [54])\\]. Moreover, modularity is known to increase the overall robustness of networks since it prevents local perturbation from spreading and affecting the dynamics too much \\[ [11])\\]. Previous neuroscience studies have shown that the brain exhibits specializations–and thus, modularity–across various scales \\[ [19]), [68]), [74]), [26]), [47]), [46])\\]. For example, visual information is primarily represented in the visual cortices, auditory information in the auditory cortices, decision-making in the prefrontal cortex–each of these regions being further comprised of cell clusters processing particular kinds of information \\[ [48]), [10]), [45])\\].\n\nAnother way in which inductive biases may be expressed in the brain, beyond structure, is in terms of function : the specific neural dynamics instantiated in particular groups of neurons. Indeed, typical computations can be learned once and then recombined in subsequent tasks to enable more efficient learning; there is evidence that the brain implements such stereotyped dynamics \\[ [16]), [64])\\]. Mixing in structural inductive biases, these generic functional dynamics are often local to a certain group of neurons, forming modules \\[ [55]), [68]), [5]), [57]), [46])\\] that can perform different aspects of a task \\[ [37]), [76]), [10])\\]. Thus, a network that implements modular functional primitives, or basis-computations, could offer dynamics useful for training multiple tasks.\n\nHere, we investigate the advantages of combining structural and functional inductive biases with a modular RNN for learning multiple tasks efficiently. Specifically, our model learns a corpus of 9 different tasks from the neuroscience literature by building on top of shared, frozen latent modules. These modules are pre-trained to produce simple computations that constitute shared operations of the task ensemble. We achieve this by requiring modules to pre-learn leading canonical components of transformations required by the corpus as a whole, thus producing a provably disentangled and maximally informative latent representation (i.e., explaining the most covariance between input and outputs). Importantly, we conceptualize the pre-trained dynamics as being acquired through evolution \\[ [17])\\] or another biologically instantiated meta-learning process \\[ [6]), [73])\\], providing a biologically plausible way to access the shared statistics of many tasks encountered throughout the life of an animal. This enables representations that factorize across tasks (instead of the task-specific features usually obtained in a continual learning scenario \\[ [76])\\]). Afterward, the different tasks can be learned sequentially simply by using task-specific output heads. We call the resulting model a Modular Latent Primitive (MoLaP) network.\n\nAltogether, we show that by leveraging aplastic functional modules fitted on a corpus’ shared statistics, our system is able to sequentially learn multiple tasks more efficiently than in typical continual learning approaches \\[ [76]), [20])\\]. Also, we demonstrate that our model is more robust to perturbations: a desirable property that biological organisms are remarkably good at \\[ [4]), [15]), [24]), [75])\\], compared to artificial systems, which are relatively sensitive \\[ [72])\\].\nNotably, even including pre-training, our method requires fewer total parameter updates to learn an entire corpus, compared to leading models of biologically plausible multi-task learning.\nFinally, we show that generalization to new tasks that share basic structure with the corpus is also facilitated. This draws a path towards cheaper multi-task solutions, and offers new hypotheses for how continual learning might be implemented in the biological brain.",

            "content": "### 2.1 Recurrent neural networks\n\nSimilar to the brain, computations in a RNN are implemented by the collective dynamics of a recurrently connected population of neurons \\[ [38])\\]. In fact, when trained on similar tasks as animals, RNNs have been shown to produce dynamics consistent with those observed in animals; they can therefore serve as a proxy for computational studies of the brain \\[ [48]), [61]), [76]), [60]), [35]), [80]), [10]), [58]), [71]), [45]), [70]), [3]), [8]), [69])\\]. Thus, by showing the benefits of pre-trained recurrent modules in RNNs, we offer a hypothesis for how multi-task learning is implemented in the brain.\n\nWhile classic RNNs are trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT), reservoir computing approaches such as echo-state networks (ESNs) and liquid-state machines (LSMs) \\[ [53]), [34]), [42])\\] avoid learning the recurrent weights of the network and instead only learn an output layer on top of a random high-dimensional expansion of the input produced by a random RNN called a reservoir. This avoids common problems that come with training RNNs \\[ [31])\\] and can increase performance while significantly lowering the computational cost \\[ [53]), [34]), [42])\\]. Our approach mixes both plastic RNNs and reservoir architectures, as modules can be seen as non-random reservoirs initialized to be maximally informative and performing independent computations in isolation.\n\nThe use of connected modules in RNNs is motivated by the fact that dynamical processes in the world can usually be described causally by the interaction between a few independent and reusable mechanisms \\[ [54])\\]; modularity in RNNs — which doesn’t emerge naturally \\[ [14])\\] — has been shown to increase generalization capabilities \\[ [27]), [28]), [65]), [40]), [30]), [33]), [33]), [62])\\].\n\n### 2.2 Learning multiple tasks\n\nIn Multi-Task Learning (MTL) \\[ [13])\\], the model has access to the data of all tasks at all times and must learn them all with the implicit goal of sharing knowledge between tasks. Typically, the model is separated into shared and task-specific parts which are learned end-to-end with gradient descent on all the tasks jointly (batches mix all the tasks).\nWhile we do require information about all tasks simultaneously for our pre-training step, how we do so sets us apart from other MTL methods. Indeed, the modules are trained on (the first few canonical components of) the shared computation statistics of the tasks rather than directly on tasks themselves; and we argue this offer a more realistic account of optimization pressure animals are subject to over long timescales (e.g., evolution or development). Most previous MTL studies using RNNs focus on NLP or vision tasks. The most similar to our approach is \\[ [76])\\], which uses the same set of cognitive tasks we do, but does not use modules and trains shared parameters end-to-end jointly on all tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, in Continual Learning (CL) \\[ [29]), [78]), [1]), [51]), [25]), [77]), [67]), [66]), [80]), [36]), [81]), [41]), [18]), [63]), [12])\\], the system has to learn many different tasks sequentially and has only access to task-relevant data, one at a time. The main focus of this line of work is to alleviate the hard problem of catastrophic forgetting that comes with training shared representation sequentially \\[ [39]), [23]), [59])\\]. We avoid this issue completely by assuming the pre-existence of aplastic modular primitives provided by statistical pre-training; all our shared parameters are frozen. Indeed, once the modules are set, our work can be conceptualized as continual learning since the tasks’ output heads are learned sequentially. Note that other CL methods freeze previously learned parameters to avoid interference \\[ [63]), [44])\\], but they do so one task at a time. Therefore, frozen representations end up being task-specific rather than factorized across tasks like ours; which hurts their efficiency. Closest to our approach is \\[ [20])\\] in that they consider the same tasks, however, they learn the shared parameters progressively in orthogonal subspaces to protect them from interference. We use them as our main point of comparison to show the benefits of our approach over typical CL.\n\nFinally, in Meta-Learning\\[ [32])\\], a single model learns to solve a family of tasks by learning on two time-scales. In particular, in gradient-based meta-learning \\[ [21]), [49])\\], a network initialization which is good for all tasks is learned over many meta-training steps, speeding up the training of new tasks. The pre-training of the modules on the joint statistics of the corpus in our system has a similar motivation: acquiring primitive latent representations useful across tasks to speed up learning of individual tasks.\n\n### 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning\n\nWorks in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) \\[ [52])\\] also use so-called primitive policies in order to solve (sometimes multiple \\[ [2])\\]) decision making tasks. In this case, the primitives are complete policies pre-trained to perform some basic action (e.g., move to the right) and they are composed sequentially (in time) to perform complex tasks. In our case, the primitives are combined in a latent space by the output layer, thus achieving a different type of compositionality. We also use a supervised learning objective to train our model.\n\n![Refer to caption]Fig 1: Modular latent primitives (MoLaP) network overview. A.

Modules are inter-connected with the reservoir, but not directly to each other ( [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A).

Modules are trained sequentially on latent primitives (see Section [3.3]Deriving latent primitives ‣ 3 Model and experimental details ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")) such that only intra-module connections of the module currently being trained are allowed to change, while the others remain frozen. The gradient of the error, however, is computed across the whole network. Thus for the case outlined in [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\"), for example, module 1 (M1) is trained first, followed by modules 2 (M2) and 3 (M3). When M1 is being trained, only connections inside of M1 are allowed to change, while the connections in the rest of the network remain frozen. After that, M1 connections are frozen, and M2’s intra-module connections are unfrozen for training.\n\n### 3.2 Tasks\n\nNeuroscience tasks \\[ [76])\\], like the ones we employ here (explained in greater detail in [A.1]A.1 Tasks ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")), are structured as trials, analogous to separate training batches. In each trial, stimuli are randomly drawn, e.g., from a distribution of possible orientations. In a given trial, there is an initial period without a stimulus in which animals are required to maintain fixation. Then, in the stimulus period, a stimulus appears for a given duration and the animal is again required to maintain fixation without responding. Finally, in the response period, the animal is allowed to make a response.\n\n### 3.3 Deriving latent primitives\n\nWe derive inputs and targets for pre-training directly from the entire corpus of tasks by leveraging canonical correlation analysis (CCA; [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A):\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | (A′,B′)=argmaxA,Bc​o​r​r​(A⊺​XT​1−9,B⊺​YT​1−9)superscriptA′superscriptB′subscriptargmaxAB𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟superscriptA⊺superscriptX𝑇19superscriptB⊺superscriptY𝑇19\\\\displaystyle(\\\\textbf{A}^{{}^{\\\\prime}},\\\\textbf{B}^{{}^{\\\\prime}})\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\operatorname\\*{argmax}\\_{\\\\textbf{A},\\\\textbf{B}}\\\\,corr(\\\\textbf{A}^{\\\\intercal}\\\\textbf{X}^{T1-9},\\\\textbf{B}^{\\\\intercal}\\\\textbf{Y}^{T1-9}) |  | (2) |\n|  | Un​x​r=A⊺′​XVn​x​r=B⊺′​Y\\\\displaystyle\\\\newline<br>\\\\textbf{U}\\_{n\\\\,x\\\\,r}\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\textbf{A}^{{}^{\\\\prime}\\\\intercal}\\\\textbf{X}\\\\,\\\\hskip 68.28644pt\\\\,\\\\textbf{V}\\_{n\\\\,x\\\\,r}\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\textbf{B}^{{}^{\\\\prime}\\\\intercal}\\\\textbf{Y} |  |\n\nIn CCA, we seek A and B such that the correlation between the two variables X (task inputs) and Y (task outputs) is maximized. We then obtain the canonical variates U and V by projecting A and B back into the sample space of inputs and outputs, respectively, with n𝑛n: number samples and r𝑟r: number of latent dimensions. The canonical variates are used to pre-train the modules ( [3.1]Modularity ‣ 3 Model and experimental details ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")), with latent dimensions r=1,2,3,..𝑟123r=1,2,3,.. corresponding to module numbers M=1,2,3,…𝑀123…M=1,2,3,... ( [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A).\n\n### 3.4 Task training\n\nIn the task-training phase ( [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") B), recurrent weights remain aplastic (like in reservoir computing) and only input and output weights are allowed to change.\nTask-specific input (Wi​nsubscriptW𝑖𝑛\\\\textbf{W}\\_{in}) and readout weights (Wo​u​tsubscriptW𝑜𝑢𝑡\\\\textbf{W}\\_{out}) are trained by minimizing a task-specifc loss function (Eq [1]In 3.1 Modularity ‣ 3 Model and experimental details ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")).

            "content": "Training multiple tasks with separate networks requires a high total number of parameters (as separate networks are used for each task) as well as a high number of parameter updates (as all of the network parameters are updated for each task).

Thus, DNI still requires 9.18​e​59.18𝑒59.18e5 parameters to be optimized ( [Table 1]Table 1 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")-DNI).\n\nSimilar to DNI, our approach (MoLaP) uses one network to perform all tasks; but MoLaP keeps both the total number of parameters, and the number of parameter updates low ( [Figure 1]Fig 1 ‣ 2.3 Relationship with hierarchical reinforcement learning ‣ 2 Relation to prior work ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") C-MoLaP).

See [A]Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for further details.\n\nDespite low parameter update requirements, using MoLaP, we achieve similar performance to both independent networks and DNI ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")), with successful learning (>70%absentpercent70>70\\\\% decisions correct) across all 9 tasks ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A,B).\nTo further investigate the role of latent primitive representations in MoLaP, we also compared a MoLaP version without pre-training (using randomly initialized modules like in reservoir computing), and a version using principal components analysis (PCA) instead of CCA to obtain latent inputs and targets for pre-training ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A). PCA offers an alternative way to derive latent primitives, and differs from CCA by successively maximizing the variance in the latent dimensions separately for inputs and outputs. The distinction is that PCA extracts a low-dimensional space from a single dataset (the covariance matrix), while CCA explicitly extracts modes that maximize variance across variables (the cross-covariance matrix; see also [A]Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for further details). This feature turns out to be crucial for deriving useful latent primitives.\n\nPerformance is more similar for easier tasks (T1-T4) than for more complex tasks (T5-T9), where flexible input-output mapping is required \\[ [19])\\]. However, only MoLaP achieves the highest performance across all tasks. We show the performance of the trained MoLaP network with pre-training ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") D) and without ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") E) on task T7 (context-dependent memory task 1, see [A.1]A.1 Tasks ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for task details). With pre-training, both readout variables hit the target ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Da-b) and decisions can be decoded correctly across the test set ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Dc-d), while in the version without pre-training, one of the readout variables misses the target ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Eb) and thus leads to incorrect decisions ( [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Ed).\n\n### 4.1 Perturbations\n\n![Refer to caption]Fig 3: Performance after modular perturbations.

Performance (%percent\\\\% decisions correct on a 2000 trial test set) as a function of percentage module 1 (M1) weights lesioned (A1), module 2 (M2) weights lesioned (A2), inter-module weights lesioned (A3), weights lesioned globally (B1), sigma of Gaussian noise added globally (B2, and percentage of units with activity silenced across the entire network (B3). Performance is computed across all nine tasks in the corpus\n\nWe analyzed performance after modular weight lesion for the different approaches, here shown for task T9 ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\"); see [Figure S1]Fig S1 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")& [Figure S2]Fig S2 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for a complete overview of tasks T1-T9)). Weights are ”lesioned\" by picking a percentage of entries Wr​e​ci,jsuperscriptsubscript𝑊𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑗W\\_{rec}^{i,j} from the connectivity matrix ( [Equation 1]Modularity ‣ 3 Model and experimental details ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")) and setting them to zero. With module 1 (M1) weights lesioned, MoLaP performance remained high when <10%absentpercent10<10\\\\% of the intra-module weights were lesioned, above that of DNI and comparable to separately trained networks ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A). With module 2 (M2) weights lesioned, MoLaP performance remained high even at a higher percentage of intra-module weights lesioned, above that of DNI and separate networks ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") B). When plotting outputs of MoLaP at 30%percent3030\\\\% of the M2 weights lesioned, we observed that the output signal of output unit 1 remained high, resulting in a higher percentage of correctly decoded decisions on average ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Bb,d) compared to when M1 was lesioned ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Ab,d). This can be explained by the fact that the first dimension of the canonical variables (on which M1 was trained) captures a higher percentage of the variance between inputs and targets than the second dimension (on which M2 was trained). Hence, when M2 is lesioned, M1 is still able to compensate and performance is preserved.\n\nWe also considered the effect of lesioning inter-module connections ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") C). Performance degrades quickly when inter-weights are lesioned, for all approaches. When plotting outputs of MoLaP at 30%percent3030\\\\% inter-module connections lesioned, we observed that the combined error across output variables is higher compared to lesioning intra-module weights ( [Figure 3]Fig 3 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Cb-e). Based on this we would predict that cutting connections between areas is far more devastating than killing a few units within an area.\n\nFurthermore, we analyzed performance after a number of different global perturbations ( [Figure S3]Fig S3 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\"), [Figure S4]Fig S4 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\"), [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")). We considered three different global perturbations: lesioning entries in the connectivity matrix, adding global Gaussian noise to the entire connectivity matrix, and silencing activity of units in the network (by clamping their activity at zero). All perturbations are repeated for 30 random draws.\n\nWe found that on simpler tasks such as T1 ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A), all approaches perform similarly for the various global perturbations (see [Figure S3]Fig S3 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")& [Figure S4]Fig S4 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for all tasks). DNI performed somewhat better than the other approaches on simpler tasks when weights and activity were lesioned ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") A,C), and somewhat worse than other approaches when noise was added globally ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") B). On more complex tasks such as T7 ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") B), however, we found that MoLaP was more robust to global perturbations. MoLaP performance remained higher compared to other approaches when up to 10%percent1010\\\\% of connections were lesioned ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Ba) or when up to 10%percent1010\\\\% of units were silenced ( [Figure 4]Fig 4 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Bc). MoLaP performance was also robust to global noise, even at relatively high levels ( [Figure S5]Fig S5 ‣ A.5 Supplementary results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") Bb).\n\n![Refer to caption]Fig 5: Generalization performance. Performance (%percent\\\\% decisions correct on a 200020002000-trial test set) for all tasks, after pre-training with CCA where all tasks were included (grey), pre-training with CCA where one task (dark blue) or two (light blue) tasks were left out, and pre-training with PCA where one task (dark green) or two tasks (light green) were left out. For leave-one-out, the left-out task corresponds to the task depicted on the x-axis. For leave-two-out, the task depicted and the one immediately next on the right were left out (in the case of T9, both T9 and T1 were left out).\n\nOver the space of all the tasks we consider, we found that MoLaP performed better than the other approaches for all the perturbations under consideration ( [Figure 4]Fig 4 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")).\n\n### 4.2 Generalization\n\nFinally, we analyzed the generalization performance of MoLaP by holding out each tasks, in turn, from the entire corpus used to derive the canonical variables for pre-training ( [Figure 5]Fig 5 ‣ 4.1 Perturbations ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\"); see section [3]Model and experimental details ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\") for details). We found that performance generalized to the left-out task relatively well, achieving higher performance than pre-training on the complete corpus using PCA (see [Figure 2]Fig 2 ‣ 4 Results ‣ Efficient And Robust Multi-Task Learning In The Brain With Modular Latent Primitives\")). We also observed some task-specific effects; performance on T7 was relatively worse when it was left out from the corpus of tasks used in pre-training, compared to when other tasks were left out. Even when two tasks were left out, MoLaP dynamics still generalized well with performance remaining high on the majority of tasks.

            "content": "We present a new approach for multi-task learning leveraging pre-trained modular latent primitives that act as inductive biases acquired through evolution or previous experience on shared statistics of a task corpus. The modules are inspired from organization of brain activity and provide useful dynamics for\nsolving a number of different tasks; including those that are not in the corpus used for pre-training, but share some structure with it (i.e., generalization). We showed that our approach achieves high performance across all tasks, while not suffering from the effects of task order or task interference that might\narise with other continual learning approaches \\[ [20]), [81])\\].\nCrucially, our approach achieves high performance with ∼2similar-toabsent2\\\\sim 2 orders of magnitude fewer parameter updates\ncompared to other approaches (even including the pre-training phase) at the cost of only a moderate increase in the number of total parameters. MoLaP scales better with tasks, thus reducing overall training cost.\n\nOur results also show that networks composed of pre-trained task modules are more robust to perturbations, even when perturbations are specifically targeted at particular modules. As readouts may draw upon dynamics across different modules, task performance is not drastically affected by the failure of any one particular module. The lower performance of the fully connected modular network may be due to the trained connection weights, which increase the inter-connectivity of different cell clusters and thus the susceptibility of local cell clusters to perturbations in distal parts of the network.\n\nThis result generates useful hypotheses for multi-task learning in the brain. It suggests that decision-making related circuits in the brain, such as in the prefrontal cortex, need not re-adjust all weights during learning.\nRather, pre-existing dynamics may be leveraged to solve new tasks. This prediction could be tested by using recurrent networks fitted to population activity recorded from the brain \\[ [56]), [50])\\] as reservoirs of useful dynamics. We hypothesize that the fitted networks contain dynamics useful to new tasks; if so, it should be possible to train readout weights to perform new tasks. Moreover, targeted lesions may be performed to study the effect of perturbations on network dynamics in the brain; our work suggests networks with functional task modules are less prone to being disrupted by perturbations. Based on our work we would also expect functional modules to encode a set of basis-tasks (commonly occurring dynamics) for the purpose of solving future tasks.\n\nIn a recent study, \\[ [22])\\] examined the effects of ’rich’ and ’lazy’ learning on acquired task representations and compared their findings to network representations in the brain of macaques and humans.\nThe lazy learning paradigm is similar to ours in as far as learning is confined to readout weights; but\nit lacks our modular approach and does not show performance on multiple tasks. Conversely, our networks are\nnot initialized with high variance weights as in the lazy regime. Ultimately, we observe improved robustness using our approach, unlike lazy learning which appears to confer lower robustness compared with rich learning.\n\nThis work enhances our understanding of resource-efficient continual learning in recurrent neural networks. As such, we do not anticipate any direct ethical or societal impact. Over the long-term, our work can have impact on related research communities such as neuroscience and deep learning, with societal impact depending on the development of these fields.",

            "content": "Humans have a remarkable ability to quickly grasp new concepts from a very small number of examples or a limited amount of experience, leveraging prior knowledge and context. In contrast, traditional deep learning approaches (LeCun et al., [2015]); Schmidhuber, [2015])) treat each task independently and hence are often data inefficient –\ndespite providing significant performance improvements across the board, such as for image classification (Simonyan & Zisserman, [2014]); He et al., [2016])), reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., [2015]); Silver et al., [2017])), and machine translation (Cho et al., [2014]); Sutskever et al., [2014])).\nJust as humans can efficiently learn new tasks, it is desirable for learning algorithms to quickly adapt to and incorporate new and unseen information.\n\n_Few-shot learning tasks_ challenge models to learn a new concept or behaviour with very few examples or limited experience (Fei-Fei et al., [2006]); Lake et al., [2011])).\nOne approach to address this class of problems is meta-learning, a broad family of techniques focused on learning how to learn or to quickly adapt to new information.\nMore specifically, _optimization-based_ meta-learning approaches (Ravi & Larochelle, [2017]); Finn et al., [2017])) aim to find a single set of model parameters that can be adapted with a few steps of gradient descent to individual tasks. However, using only a few samples (typically 1 or 5) to compute gradients in a high-dimensional parameter space could make generalization difficult, especially under the constraint of a shared starting point for task-specific adaptation.\n\nIn this work we propose a new approach, named Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO), which learns a low-dimensional latent embedding of model parameters and performs optimization-based meta-learning in this space. Intuitively, the approach provides two advantages. First, the initial parameters for a new task are conditioned on the training data, which enables a task-specific starting point for adaptation. By incorporating a relation network into the encoder, this initialization can better consider the joint relationship between all of the input data. Second, by optimizing in the lower-dimensional latent space, the approach can adapt the behaviour of the model more effectively. Further, by allowing this process to be stochastic, the ambiguities present in the few-shot data regime can be expressed.\n\nWe demonstrate that LEO achieves state-of-the-art results on both the miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, and run an ablation study and further analysis to show that both conditional parameter generation and optimization in latent space are critical for the success of the method.

[1]In 2.2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")); and termination, which is handled simply by choosing a fixed number of optimization steps in the “inner loop”.\nMAML updates θ𝜃\\\\theta by differentiating through the “inner loop” in order to minimize errors of instance-specific adapted models fθi′subscript𝑓superscriptsubscript𝜃𝑖′f\\_{\\\\theta\\_{i}^{\\\\prime}} on the corresponding validation set (Eq. [2]In 2.2 Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")). We refer to this process as the “outer loop” of meta-learning.\nIn the next section we use the same stages to describe Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO).\n\n### 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning\n\nThe primary contribution of this paper is to show that it is possible, and indeed beneficial, to decouple optimization-based meta-learning techniques from the high-dimensional space of model parameters. We achieve this by learning a stochastic latent space with an information bottleneck, conditioned on the input data, from which the high-dimensional parameters are generated.\n\nInstead of explicitly instantiating and maintaining a unique set of model parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta, as in MAML, we learn a generative distribution of model parameters which serves the same purpose. This is a natural extension: we relax the requirement of finding a single optimal θ∗∈Θsuperscript𝜃∗Θ\\\\theta^{\\\\ast}\\\\in\\\\Theta to that of approximating a data-dependent conditional probability distribution over ΘΘ\\\\Theta, which can be more expressive.\nThe choice of architecture, composed of an encoding process, and decoding (or parameter generation) process, enables us to perform the MAML gradient-based adaptation steps (or “inner loop”) in the learned, low-dimensional embedding space of the parameter generative model (Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")).\n\n0:  Training meta-set 𝒮t​r∈𝒯superscript𝒮𝑡𝑟𝒯\\\\mathcal{S}^{{tr}}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{T}\n\n0:  Learning rates α𝛼\\\\alpha, η𝜂\\\\eta\n\n1:  Randomly initialize ϕe,ϕr,ϕdsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑\\\\phi\\_{{e}},\\\\phi\\_{{r}},\\\\phi\\_{{d}}\n\n2:  Let ϕ={ϕe,ϕr,ϕd,α}italic-ϕsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑𝛼\\\\phi=\\\\{\\\\phi\\_{{e}},\\\\phi\\_{{r}},\\\\phi\\_{{d}},\\\\alpha\\\\}\n\n3:while not converged do\n\n4:for number of tasks in batch do\n\n5:        Sample task instance 𝒯i∼𝒮t​rsimilar-tosubscript𝒯𝑖superscript𝒮𝑡𝑟\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{S}^{{tr}}\n\n6:        Let (𝒟t​r,𝒟v​a​l)=𝒯isuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑟superscript𝒟𝑣𝑎𝑙subscript𝒯𝑖\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{D}^{{tr}},\\\\mathcal{D}^{{val}}\\\\right)=\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}\n\n7:        Encode 𝒟t​rsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑟\\\\mathcal{D}^{{tr}} to 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} using gϕesubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{e}}} and gϕrsubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{r}}}\n\n8:        Decode 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} to initial params θisubscript𝜃𝑖{\\\\theta\\_{i}} using gϕdsubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{d}}}\n\n9:        Initialize 𝐳′=𝐳superscript𝐳′𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}={\\\\mathbf{z}}, θi′=θisubscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖subscript𝜃𝑖\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}=\\\\theta\\_{i}\n\n10:for number of adaptation steps do\n\n11:           Compute training loss ℒ𝒯it​r​(fθi′)subscriptsuperscriptℒ𝑡𝑟subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖\\\\mathcal{L}^{{tr}}\\_{{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}}\\\\big{(}f\\_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}}\\\\big{)}\n\n12:           Perform gradient step w.r.t. 𝐳′superscript𝐳′{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}: 𝐳′←𝐳′−α​∇𝐳′ℒ𝒯it​r​(fθi′)←superscript𝐳′superscript𝐳′𝛼subscript∇superscript𝐳′subscriptsuperscriptℒ𝑡𝑟subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}\\\\leftarrow{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}-\\\\alpha\\\\nabla\\_{{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}}\\\\mathcal{L}^{{tr}}\\_{{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}}\\\\big{(}f\\_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}}\\\\big{)}\n\n13:           Decode 𝐳′superscript𝐳′{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime} to obtain θi′subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}} using gϕdsubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{d}}}\n\n14:endfor\n\n15:        Compute validation loss ℒ𝒯iv​a​l​(fθi′)subscriptsuperscriptℒ𝑣𝑎𝑙subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖\\\\mathcal{L}^{{val}}\\_{{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}}\\\\big{(}f\\_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}}\\\\big{)}\n\n16:endfor\n\n17:     Perform gradient step w.r.t ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi: ϕ←ϕ−η​∇ϕ​∑𝒯iℒ𝒯iv​a​l​(fθi′)←italic-ϕitalic-ϕ𝜂subscript∇italic-ϕsubscriptsubscript𝒯𝑖subscriptsuperscriptℒ𝑣𝑎𝑙subscript𝒯𝑖subscript𝑓subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖\\\\phi\\\\leftarrow\\\\phi-\\\\eta\\\\nabla\\_{\\\\phi}\\\\sum\\_{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}\\\\mathcal{L}^{{val}}\\_{{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}}\\\\big{(}f\\_{\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}}\\\\big{)}\n\n18:endwhile\n\nAlgorithm 1 Latent Embedding Optimization\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: High-level intuition for LEO.

First, given a task instance 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}, the inputs {𝐱nk}superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑛𝑘\\\\{{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{n}^{k}\\\\} are passed through a stochastic encoder to produce a latent code 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}}, which is then decoded to parameters θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\\\theta\\_{i} using a parameter generator111Note that we omit the task subscript i𝑖i from latent code 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} and input data 𝐱nksuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑛𝑘{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{n}^{k} for clarity..\n\nGiven these instantiated model parameters, one or more adaptation steps are applied in the latent space, by differentiating the loss with respect to 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}}, taking a gradient step to get 𝐳′superscript𝐳′{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}, decoding new model parameters, and obtaining the new loss. Finally, optimized codes are decoded to produce the final adapted parameters θi′subscriptsuperscript𝜃′𝑖\\\\theta^{\\\\prime}\\_{i}, which can be used to perform the task, or compute the task-specific meta-loss.\nIn this way, LEO incorporates aspects of model-based and optimization-based meta-learning, producing parameters that are first conditioned on the input data and then adapted by gradient descent.\n\nFigure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\") shows the architecture of the resulting network.\nIntuitively, the decoder is akin to a generative model, mapping from a low-dimensional latent code to a distribution over model parameters. The encoding process ensures that the initial latent code and parameters before gradient-based adaptation are already data-dependent. This encoding process also exploits a relation network that allows the latent code to be context-dependent, considering the pairwise relationship between all classes in the problem instance.\nIn the following sections, we explain the LEO procedure more formally.\n\n#### 2.3.2 Initialization: Generating Parameters Conditioned on a Few Examples\n\nThe first stage is to instantiate the model parameters that will be adapted to each task instance.\nWhereas MAML explicitly maintains a single set of model parameters, LEO utilises a data-dependent latent encoding which is then decoded to generate the actual initial parameters.\nIn what follows, we describe an encoding scheme which leverages a relation network to map the few-shot examples into a single latent vector.\nThis design choice allows the approach to consider context when producing a parameter initialization. Intuitively, decision boundaries required for fine-grained distinctions between similar classes might need to be different from those for broader classification.\n\n##### Encoding\n\nThe encoding process involves a simple feed-forward mapping of each data point, followed by a relation network that considers the pair-wise relationship between the data in the problem instance.\nThe overall encoding process is defined in Eq. [3]In Encoding ‣ 2.3.2 Initialization: Generating Parameters Conditioned on a Few Examples ‣ 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\"), and proceeds as follows.\nFirst, each example from a problem instance 𝒯i=(𝒟t​r,𝒟v​a​l)∼p​(𝒯)subscript𝒯𝑖superscript𝒟𝑡𝑟superscript𝒟𝑣𝑎𝑙similar-to𝑝𝒯\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}=\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{D}^{{tr}},\\\\mathcal{D}^{{val}}\\\\right)\\\\sim p\\\\left(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\right) is processed by an encoder network gϕe:ℛnx→ℛnh:subscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒→superscriptℛsubscript𝑛𝑥superscriptℛsubscript𝑛ℎg\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{e}}}\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{R}^{n\\_{x}}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{R}^{n\\_{h}}, which maps from input space to a code\nin an intermediate hidden-layer code space ℋℋ\\\\mathcal{H}.\nThen, codes in ℋℋ\\\\mathcal{H} corresponding to different training examples are concatenated pair-wise (resulting in (N​K)2superscript𝑁𝐾2(NK)^{2} pairs in the case of K𝐾K-shot classification) and processed by a relation network gϕrsubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{r}}}, in a similar fashion to Oreshkin et al. ( [2018])) and Sung et al. ( [2017])).\nThe (N​K)2superscript𝑁𝐾2(NK)^{2} outputs are grouped by class and averaged within each group to obtain the (2×N2𝑁2\\\\times N) parameters of a probability distribution in a low-dimensional space 𝒵=ℛnz𝒵superscriptℛsubscript𝑛𝑧\\\\mathcal{Z}=\\\\mathcal{R}^{n\\_{z}}, where nz≪dim​(θ)much-less-thansubscript𝑛𝑧dim𝜃n\\_{z}\\\\ll\\\\textrm{dim}(\\\\theta), for each of the N𝑁N classes.\n\nThus, given the K𝐾K-shot training samples corresponding to a class n𝑛n:\n𝒟nt​r={(𝐱nk,ynk)∣k=1​…​K}superscriptsubscript𝒟𝑛𝑡𝑟conditional-setsuperscriptsubscript𝐱𝑛𝑘superscriptsubscript𝑦𝑛𝑘𝑘1…𝐾\\\\mathcal{D}\\_{n}^{{tr}}=\\\\big{\\\\{}\\\\big{(}{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{n}^{k},{y}\\_{n}^{k}\\\\big{)}\\\\mid k=1\\\\dots K\\\\big{\\\\}}\nthe encoder gϕesubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{e}}} and relation network gϕrsubscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{r}}} together parameterize a class-conditional multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance, which we can sample from in order to output a class-dependent latent code 𝐳n∈𝒵subscript𝐳𝑛𝒵{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Z} as follows:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 𝝁ne,𝝈nesuperscriptsubscript𝝁𝑛𝑒superscriptsubscript𝝈𝑛𝑒\\\\displaystyle{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}\\_{n}^{{e}},{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}\\_{n}^{{e}} | =\\\\displaystyle= | 1N​K2​∑kn=1K∑m=1N∑km=1Kgϕr​(gϕe​(𝐱nkn),gϕe​(𝐱mkm))1𝑁superscript𝐾2superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑘𝑛1𝐾superscriptsubscript𝑚1𝑁superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝑘𝑚1𝐾subscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟subscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑛subscript𝑘𝑛subscript𝑔subscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒superscriptsubscript𝐱𝑚subscript𝑘𝑚\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{1}{NK^{2}}\\\\sum\\_{k\\_{n}=1}^{K}\\\\sum\\_{m=1}^{N}\\\\sum\\_{k\\_{m}=1}^{K}g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{r}}}\\\\Big{(}g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{e}}}\\\\left({\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{n}^{k\\_{n}}\\\\right),g\\_{\\\\phi\\_{{e}}}\\\\left({\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{m}^{k\\_{m}}\\\\right)\\\\Big{)} |  | (3) |\n|  |  |  | 𝐳n∼q​(𝐳n\\|𝒟nt​r)=𝒩​(𝝁ne,d​i​a​g​(𝝈ne2))similar-tosubscript𝐳𝑛𝑞conditionalsubscript𝐳𝑛superscriptsubscript𝒟𝑛𝑡𝑟𝒩superscriptsubscript𝝁𝑛𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔superscriptsuperscriptsubscript𝝈𝑛𝑒2\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{n}\\\\sim q\\\\left({\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{n}\\|\\\\mathcal{D}\\_{n}^{{tr}}\\\\right)=\\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left({\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}\\_{n}^{{e}},diag({{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}\\_{n}^{{e}}}^{2})\\\\right) |  |\n\nIntuitively, the encoder and relation network define a stochastic mapping from one or more class examples to a single code in the latent embedding space 𝒵𝒵\\\\mathcal{Z} corresponding to that class.\nThe final latent code can be obtained as the concatenation of class-dependent codes: 𝐳=\\[𝐳1,𝐳2,…,𝐳N\\]𝐳subscript𝐳1subscript𝐳2…subscript𝐳𝑁{\\\\mathbf{z}}=\\[{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{1},{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{2},\\\\dots,{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{N}\\].\n\n##### Decoding\n\nWithout loss of generality, for few-shot classification, we can use the class-specific latent codes to instantiate just the top layer weights of the classifier.

Similar to the loss defined in (Higgins et al., [2017])) we use a weighted KL-divergence term to regularize the latent space and encourage the generative model to learn a disentangled embedding, which should also simplify the LEO “inner loop” by removing correlations between latent space gradient dimensions.\nThe third term in Eq. ( [6]In 2.3.4 Meta-Training Strategy (The “Outer Loop”) ‣ 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")) encourages the encoder and relation net to output a parameter initialization that is close to the adapted code, thereby reducing the load of the adaptation procedure if possible.\n\nL2subscript𝐿2L\\_{2} regularization was used with all weights of the model, as well as a soft, layer-wise orthogonality constraint on decoder network weights, which encourages the dimensions of the latent code as well as the decoder network to be maximally expressive. In the case of linear encoder, relation, and decoder networks, and assuming that 𝒞dsubscript𝒞𝑑\\\\mathcal{C}\\_{{d}} is the correlation matrix between rows of ϕdsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑\\\\phi\\_{{d}}, then the regularization term takes the following form:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | R=λ1​(‖ϕe‖22+‖ϕr‖22+‖ϕd‖22)+λ2​‖𝒞d−ℐ‖2𝑅subscript𝜆1superscriptsubscriptnormsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑒22superscriptsubscriptnormsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑟22superscriptsubscriptnormsubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑑22subscript𝜆2subscriptnormsubscript𝒞𝑑ℐ2R=\\\\lambda\\_{1}\\\\Big{(}\\|\\|\\\\phi\\_{{e}}\\|\\|\\_{2}^{2}+\\|\\|\\\\phi\\_{{r}}\\|\\|\\_{2}^{2}+\\|\\|\\\\phi\\_{d}\\|\\|\\_{2}^{2}\\\\Big{)}+\\\\lambda\\_{2}\\|\\|\\\\mathcal{C}\\_{{d}}-\\\\mathcal{I}\\|\\|\\_{2} |  | (7) |\n\n#### 2.3.5 Beyond Classification and Linear Output Layers\n\nThus far we have used few-shot classification as a working example to highlight our proposed method, and in this domain we generate only a single linear output layer.\nHowever, our approach can be applied to any model fθisubscript𝑓subscript𝜃𝑖f\\_{\\\\theta\\_{i}} which maps observations to outputs, e.g. a nonlinear MLP or LSTM, by using a single latent code 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} to generate the entire parameter vector θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\\\theta\\_{i} with an appropriate decoder.

            "content": "The problem of few-shot adaptation has been approached in the context of _fast weights_(Hinton & Plaut, [1987]); Ba et al., [2016])), _learning-to-learn_(Schmidhuber, [1987]); Thrun & Pratt, [1998]); Hochreiter et al., [2001]); Andrychowicz et al., [2016])), and through _meta-learning_.\nMany recent approaches to meta-learning can be broadly categorized as metric-based methods, which focus on learning similarity metrics for members of the same class (e.g. Koch et al., [2015]); Vinyals et al., [2016]); Snell et al., [2017])); memory-based methods, which exploit memory architectures to store key training examples or directly encode fast adaptation algorithms (e.g. Santoro et al., [2016]); Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])); and optimization-based methods, which search for parameters that are conducive to fast gradient-based adaptation to new tasks (e.g. Finn et al., [2017]); [2018])).\n\nRelated work has also explored the use of one neural network to produce (some fraction of) the parameters of another (Ha et al., [2016]); Krueger et al., [2017])), with some approaches focusing on the goal of fast adaptation.\nMunkhdalai et al. ( [2017])) meta-learn an algorithm to change additive biases across deep networks conditioned on the few-shot training samples. In contrast, Gidaris & Komodakis ( [2018])) use an attention kernel to output class conditional mixing of linear output weights for novel categories, starting from a pre-trained deep model.\nQiao et al. ( [2017])) learn to output top linear layer parameters from the activations provided by a pre-trained feature embedding, but they do not make use of gradient-based adaptation. None of the aforementioned approaches to fast adaptation explicitly learn a probability distribution over model parameters, or make use of latent variable generative models to characterize it.\n\nApproaches which use optimization-based meta-learning include MAML (Finn et al., [2017])) and REPTILE (Nichol & Schulman, [2018])). While MAML backpropagates the meta-loss through the “inner loop”, REPTILE simplifies the computation by incorporating an L2subscript𝐿2L\\_{2} loss which updates the meta-model parameters towards the instance-specific adapted models. These approaches use the full, high-dimensional set of model parameters within the “inner loop”, while Lee & Choi ( [2018])) learn a layer-wise subspace in which to use gradient-based adaptation. However, it is not clear how these methods scale to large expressive models such as residual networks (especially given the uncertainty in the few-shot data regime), since MAML is prone to overfitting (Mishra et al., [2018])). Recognizing this issue, Zhou et al. ( [2018])) train a deep input representation, or “concept space”, and use it as input to an MLP meta-learner, but perform gradient-based adaptation directly in its parameter space, which is still comparatively high-dimensional. As we will show, performing adaptation in latent space to generate a simple linear layer can lead to superior generalization.\n\nProbabilistic meta-learning approaches such as those of Bauer et al. ( [2017])) and Grant et al. ( [2018])) have shown the advantages of learning Gaussian posteriors over model parameters.\nConcurrently with our work, Kim et al. ( [2018])) and Finn et al. ( [2018])) propose probabilistic extensions to MAML that are trained using a variational approximation, using simple posteriors. However, it is not immediately clear how to extend them to more complex distributions with a more diverse set of tasks. Other concurrent works have introduced deep parameter generators (Lacoste et al., [2018]); Wu et al., [2018])) that can better capture a wider distribution of model parameters, but do not employ gradient-based adaptation.\nIn contrast, our approach employs both a generative model of parameters, and adaptation in a low-dimensional latent space, aided by a data-dependent initialization.\n\nFinally, recently proposed Neural Processes (Garnelo et al., [2018a]); [b])) bear similarity to our work: they also learn a mapping to and from a latent space that can be used for few-shot function estimation. However, coming from a Gaussian processes perspective, their work does not perform “inner loop” adaptation and is trained by optimizing a variational objective.",

          "4 Evaluation": {
            "content": "We evaluate the proposed approach on few-shot regression and classification tasks. This evaluation aims to answer the following key questions:\n\n(1)Is LEO capable of modeling a distribution over model parameters when faced with uncertainty?\n(2)Can LEO learn from multimodal task distributions and is this reflected in ambiguous problem instances, where multiple distinct solutions are possible?\n(3)Is LEO competitive on large-scale few-shot learning benchmarks?\n\n### 4.1 Few-shot Regression\n\nTo answer the first two questions we adopt the simple regression task of Finn et al. ( [2018])). 1D regression problems are generated in equal proportions using either a sine wave with random amplitude and phase, or a line with random slope and intercept. Inputs are sampled randomly, creating a multimodal task distribution. Crucially, random Gaussian noise with standard deviation 0.30.30.3 is added to regression targets. Coupled with the small number of training samples (5-shot), the task is challenging for 2 main reasons:\n\n(1)learning a distribution over models becomes necessary, in order to account for the uncertainty introduced by noisy labels;\n(2)problem instances may be likely under both modes: in some cases a sine wave may fit the data as well as a line.\n\nFaced with such ambiguity, learning a generative distribution of model parameters should allow several different likely models to be sampled, in a similar way to how generative models such as VAEs can capture different modes of a multimodal data distribution.\n\nWe used a 3-layer MLP as the underlying model architecture of fθsubscript𝑓𝜃f\\_{\\\\theta}, and we produced the entire parameter tensor θ𝜃\\\\theta with the LEO generator, conditionally on Dt​rsuperscript𝐷𝑡𝑟D^{{tr}}, the few-shot training inputs concatenated with noisy labels. For further details, see Appendix [A]Appendix A Experimental setup - regression ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\").\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Meta-learning with LEO of a multimodal task distribution with sines and lines, using 5-shot regression with noisy targets. Our model outputs a distribution of possible solutions, which is also multimodal in ambiguous cases. True regression targets are plotted in black, while the 5 training examples are highlighted with red circles and vertical dashed lines. Several samples from our model are plotted with dotted lines (best seen in color).\n\nIn Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 4.1 Few-shot Regression ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\") we show samples from a single model trained on noisy sines and lines, with true regression targets in black and training samples marked with red circles and vertical dashed lines. Plots (a) and (b) illustrate how LEO captures some of the uncertainty in ambiguous problem instances within each mode, especially in parts of the input space far from any training samples. Conversely, in parts which contain data, models fit the regression target well. Interestingly, when both sines and lines could explain the data, as shown in panels (c) and (d), we see that LEO can sample very different models, from both families, reflecting its ability to represent parametric uncertainty appropriately.\n\n### 4.2 Few-shot Classification\n\nIn order to answer the final question we scale up our approach to 1-shot and 5-shot classification problems defined using two commonly used ImageNet subsets.\n\n#### 4.2.1 Datasets\n\nThe miniImageNet dataset (Vinyals et al., [2016])) is a subset of 100100100 classes selected randomly from the ILSVRC-12 dataset (Russakovsky et al., [2014])) with 600600600 images sampled from each class. Following the split proposed by Ravi & Larochelle ( [2017])), the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test meta-sets, with 646464, 161616, and 202020 classes respectively.\n\nThe tieredImageNet dataset (Ren et al., [2018])) is a larger subset of ILSVRC-12 with 608 classes (779,165779165779{,}165 images) grouped into 343434 higher-level nodes in the ImageNet human-curated hierarchy (Deng et al., [2009a])). This set of nodes is partitioned into 202020, 666, and 888 disjoint sets of training, validation, and testing nodes, and the corresponding classes form the respective meta-sets. As argued in Ren et al. ( [2018])), this split near the root of the ImageNet hierarchy results in a more challenging, yet realistic regime with test classes that are less similar to training classes.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Pre-trained Features\n\nTwo potential difficulties of using LEO to instantiate parameters with a generator network are: (1) modeling distributions over very high-dimensional parameter spaces; and (2) requiring meta-learning (and hence, gradient computation in the inner loop) to be performed with respect to a high-dimensional input space.\nWe address these issues by pre-training a visual representation of the data and then using the generator to instantiate the parameters for the final layer - a linear softmax classifier operating on this representation. We train a 282828-layer Wide Residual Network (WRN-28-10) (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, [2016a])) with supervised classification using only data and classes from the training meta-set. Recent state-of-the-art approaches use the penultimate layer representation (Zhou et al., [2018]); Qiao et al., [2017]); Bauer et al., [2017]); Gidaris & Komodakis, [2018])); however, we choose the intermediate feature representation in layer 212121, given that higher layers tend to specialize to the training distribution (Yosinski et al., [2014])). For details regarding the training, evaluation, and network architectures, see Appendix [B]Appendix B Experimental setup - classification ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\").\n\n#### 4.2.3 Fine-tuning\n\nFollowing the LEO adaptation procedure (Algorithm [1]Algorithm 1 ‣ 2.3 Latent Embedding Optimization for Meta-Learning ‣ 2 Model ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")) we also use fine-tuning333In this context, “fine-tuning” refers to final adaptation in parameter space, rather than fine-tuning the pre-trained feature extractor. by performing a few steps of gradient-based adaptation directly in parameter space using the few-shot set 𝒟t​rsuperscript𝒟𝑡𝑟\\\\mathcal{D}^{{tr}}. This is similar to the adaptation procedure of MAML, or Meta-SGD (Li et al., [2017])) when the learning rates are learned, with the important difference that starting points of fine-tuning are custom generated by LEO for every task instance 𝒯isubscript𝒯𝑖{\\\\mathcal{T}\\_{i}}.\nEmpirically, we find that fine-tuning applies a very small change to the parameters with only a slight improvement in performance on supervised classification tasks.\n\n### 4.3 Results\n\n| Model | miniImageNet test accuracy |\n| 1-shot | 5-shot |\n| Matching networks (Vinyals et al., [2016])) | 43.56±0.84%plus-or-minus43.56percent0.8443.56\\\\pm 0.84\\\\% | 55.31±0.73%plus-or-minus55.31percent0.7355.31\\\\pm 0.73\\\\% |\n| Meta-learner LSTM (Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])) | 43.44±0.77%plus-or-minus43.44percent0.7743.44\\\\pm 0.77\\\\% | 60.60±0.71%plus-or-minus60.60percent0.7160.60\\\\pm 0.71\\\\% |\n| MAML (Finn et al., [2017])) | 48.70±1.84%plus-or-minus48.70percent1.8448.70\\\\pm 1.84\\\\% | 63.11±0.92%plus-or-minus63.11percent0.9263.11\\\\pm 0.92\\\\% |\n| LLAMA (Grant et al., [2018])) | 49.40±1.83%plus-or-minus49.40percent1.8349.40\\\\pm 1.83\\\\% | - |\n| REPTILE (Nichol & Schulman, [2018])) | 49.97±0.32%plus-or-minus49.97percent0.3249.97\\\\pm 0.32\\\\% | 65.99±0.58%plus-or-minus65.99percent0.5865.99\\\\pm 0.58\\\\% |\n| PLATIPUS (Finn et al., [2018])) | 50.13±1.86%plus-or-minus50.13percent1.8650.13\\\\pm 1.86\\\\% | - |\n| Meta-SGD (our features) | 54.24±0.03%plus-or-minus54.24percent0.0354.24\\\\pm 0.03\\\\% | 70.86±0.04%plus-or-minus70.86percent0.0470.86\\\\pm 0.04\\\\% |\n| SNAIL (Mishra et al., [2018])) | 55.71±0.99%plus-or-minus55.71percent0.9955.71\\\\pm 0.99\\\\% | 68.88±0.92%plus-or-minus68.88percent0.9268.88\\\\pm 0.92\\\\% |\n| (Gidaris & Komodakis, [2018])) | 56.20±0.86%plus-or-minus56.20percent0.8656.20\\\\pm 0.86\\\\% | 73.00±0.64%plus-or-minus73.00percent0.6473.00\\\\pm 0.64\\\\% |\n| (Bauer et al., [2017])) | 56.30±0.40%plus-or-minus56.30percent0.4056.30\\\\pm 0.40\\\\% | 73.90±0.30%plus-or-minus73.90percent0.3073.90\\\\pm 0.30\\\\% |\n| (Munkhdalai et al., [2017])) | 57.10±0.70%plus-or-minus57.10percent0.7057.10\\\\pm 0.70\\\\% | 70.04±0.63%plus-or-minus70.04percent0.6370.04\\\\pm 0.63\\\\% |\n| DEML+Meta-SGD (Zhou et al., [2018]))444Uses the ImageNet-200 dataset (Deng et al., [2009b])) to train the concept generator. | 58.49±0.91%plus-or-minus58.49percent0.9158.49\\\\pm 0.91\\\\% | 71.28±0.69%plus-or-minus71.28percent0.6971.28\\\\pm 0.69\\\\% |\n| TADAM (Oreshkin et al., [2018])) | 58.50±0.30%plus-or-minus58.50percent0.3058.50\\\\pm 0.30\\\\% | 76.70±0.30%plus-or-minus76.70percent0.3076.70\\\\pm 0.30\\\\% |\n| (Qiao et al., [2017])) | 59.60±0.41%plus-or-minus59.60percent0.4159.60\\\\pm 0.41\\\\% | 73.74±0.19%plus-or-minus73.74percent0.1973.74\\\\pm 0.19\\\\% |\n| LEO (ours) | 61.76±0.08%plus-or-minus61.76percent0.08\\\\mathbf{61.76\\\\pm 0.08\\\\%} | 77.59±0.12%plus-or-minus77.59percent0.12\\\\mathbf{77.59\\\\pm 0.12\\\\%} |\n| Model | tieredImageNet test accuracy |\n| 1-shot | 5-shot |\n| MAML (deeper net, evaluated in Liu et al.

We also evaluated LEO on the “multi-view” feature representation used by Qiao et al.

All versions of LEO are at or above the previous state-of-the-art on all tasks.\n\nThe largest difference in performance is between Meta-SGD and the other cases (all of which exploit a latent representation of model parameters), indicating that the low-dimensional bottleneck is critical for this application.\nThe “conditional generator only” case (without adaptation in latent space) yields a poorer result than LEO, and even adding fine-tuning in parameter space does not recover performance; this illustrates the efficacy of the latent adaptation procedure.\nThe importance of the data-dependent encoding is highlighted by the “random prior” case, in which the encoding process is replaced by the prior p​(𝐳n)𝑝subscript𝐳𝑛p({\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{n}), and performance decreases.\nWe also find that incorporating stochasticity can be important for miniImageNet, but not for tieredImageNet, which we hypothesize is because the latter is much larger. Finally, the fine-tuning steps only yield a statistically significant improvement on the 5-shot tieredImageNet task.\nThus, both the data-conditional encoding and latent space adaptation are critical to the performance of LEO.\n\n| Model | miniImageNet test accuracy | tieredImageNet test accuracy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1-shot | 5-shot | 1-shot | 5-shot |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meta-SGD (our features) | 54.24±0.03%plus-or-minus54.24percent0.0354.24\\\\pm 0.03\\\\% | 70.86±0.04%plus-or-minus70.86percent0.0470.86\\\\pm 0.04\\\\% | 62.95±0.03%plus-or-minus62.95percent0.0362.95\\\\pm 0.03\\\\% | 79.34±0.06%plus-or-minus79.34percent0.0679.34\\\\pm 0.06\\\\% |\n| Conditional generator only | 60.33±0.11%plus-or-minus60.33percent0.1160.33\\\\pm 0.11\\\\% | 74.53±0.11%plus-or-minus74.53percent0.1174.53\\\\pm 0.11\\\\% | 65.17±0.15%plus-or-minus65.17percent0.1565.17\\\\pm 0.15\\\\% | 78.77±0.03%plus-or-minus78.77percent0.0378.77\\\\pm 0.03\\\\% |\n| Conditional generator + fine-tuning | 60.62±0.31%plus-or-minus60.62percent0.3160.62\\\\pm 0.31\\\\% | 76.42±0.09%plus-or-minus76.42percent0.0976.42\\\\pm 0.09\\\\% | 65.74±0.28%plus-or-minus65.74percent0.2865.74\\\\pm 0.28\\\\% | 80.65±0.07%plus-or-minus80.65percent0.0780.65\\\\pm 0.07\\\\% |\n| Previous SOTA | 59.60±0.41%plus-or-minus59.60percent0.4159.60\\\\pm 0.41\\\\% | 76.70±0.30%plus-or-minus76.70percent0.3076.70\\\\pm 0.30\\\\% | 57.41±0.94%plus-or-minus57.41percent0.9457.41\\\\pm 0.94\\\\% | 72.69±0.74%plus-or-minus72.69percent0.7472.69\\\\pm 0.74\\\\% |\n| LEO (random prior) | 61.01±0.12%plus-or-minus61.01percent0.1261.01\\\\pm 0.12\\\\% | 77.27±0.05%plus-or-minus77.27percent0.0577.27\\\\pm 0.05\\\\% | 65.39±0.10%plus-or-minus65.39percent0.1065.39\\\\pm 0.10\\\\% | 80.83±0.13%plus-or-minus80.83percent0.1380.83\\\\pm 0.13\\\\% |\n| LEO (deterministic) | 61.48±0.05%plus-or-minus61.48percent0.0561.48\\\\pm 0.05\\\\% | 76.53±0.24%plus-or-minus76.53percent0.2476.53\\\\pm 0.24\\\\% | 66.18±0.17%plus-or-minus66.18percent0.17\\\\mathbf{66.18\\\\pm 0.17\\\\%} | 82.06±0.08%plus-or-minus82.06percent0.08\\\\mathbf{82.06\\\\pm 0.08}\\\\% |\n| LEO (no fine-tuning) | 61.62±0.15%plus-or-minus61.62percent0.15\\\\mathbf{61.62\\\\pm 0.15\\\\%} | 77.46±0.12%plus-or-minus77.46percent0.12\\\\mathbf{77.46\\\\pm 0.12\\\\%} | 66.14±0.17%plus-or-minus66.14percent0.17\\\\mathbf{66.14\\\\pm 0.17}\\\\% | 80.89±0.11%plus-or-minus80.89percent0.1180.89\\\\pm 0.11\\\\% |\n| LEO (ours) | 61.76±0.08%plus-or-minus61.76percent0.08\\\\mathbf{61.76\\\\pm 0.08\\\\%} | 77.59±0.12%plus-or-minus77.59percent0.12\\\\mathbf{77.59\\\\pm 0.12\\\\%} | 66.33±0.05%plus-or-minus66.33percent0.05\\\\mathbf{66.33\\\\pm 0.05\\\\%} | 81.44±0.09%plus-or-minus81.44percent0.0981.44\\\\pm 0.09\\\\% |\n\nTable 2: Ablation study and comparison to Meta-SGD.

Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\") shows a t-SNE projection of class conditional encoder outputs 𝐳nsubscript𝐳𝑛{\\\\mathbf{z}}\\_{n} as well as their respective final adapted versions 𝐳n′subscriptsuperscript𝐳′𝑛{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}\\_{n}. If the effect of LEO were minimal, we would expect latent codes to have roughly the same structure before and after adaptation. In contrast, Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(a) clearly shows that latent codes change substantially during LEO, since encoder output codes form a large cluster (blue) to which adapted codes (orange) do not belong. Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(b) shows the same t-SNE embedding as (a) colored by class label. Note that encoder outputs, on the left side of plot (b), have a lower degree of class conditional separation compared to 𝐳n′subscriptsuperscript𝐳′𝑛{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}\\_{n} clusters on the right, suggesting that qualitatively different structure is introduced by the LEO procedure. We further illustrate this point by highlighting latent codes for the “Jellyfish” validation class in Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4.4 Ablation Study ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(c), which are substantially different before and after adaptation.\n\nThe additional structure of adapted codes 𝐳n′subscriptsuperscript𝐳′𝑛{\\\\mathbf{z}}^{\\\\prime}\\_{n} may explain LEO’s superior performance over approaches predicting parameters directly from inputs, since the decoder may not be able to produce sufficiently different weights for different classes given very similar latent codes, especially when the decoder is linear. Conversely, LEO can reduce the uncertainty of the encoder mapping, which is inherent in the few-shot regime, by adapting latent codes with a generic, gradient-based procedure.\n\n### 4.6 Curvature and coverage analysis\n\nWe hypothesize that by performing the inner-loop optimization in a lower-dimensional latent space, the adapted solutions do not need to be close together in parameter space, as each latent step can cover a larger region of parameter space and effect a greater change on the underlying function.\nTo support this intuition, we compute a number of curvature and coverage measures, shown in Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4.6 Curvature and coverage analysis ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\").\n\nThe curvature provides a measure of the sensitivity of a function with respect to some space. If adapting in latent space allows as much control over the function as in parameter space, one would expect similar curvatures. However, as demonstrated in Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4.6 Curvature and coverage analysis ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(a), the curvature for LEO in 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} space (the absolute eigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss) is 2 orders of magnitude higher than in θ𝜃\\\\theta, indicating that a fixed step in 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} will change the function more drastically than taking the same step directly in θ𝜃\\\\theta. This is also observed in the “gen+ft” case, where the latent embedding is still used, but adaptation is performed directly in θ𝜃\\\\theta space. This suggests that the latent bottleneck is responsible for this effect.\nFigure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4.6 Curvature and coverage analysis ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(b) shows that this is due to the expansion of space caused by the decoder. In this case the decoder is linear, and the singular values describe how much a vector projected through this decoder grows along different directions, with a value of one preserving volume. We observe that the decoder is expanding the space by at least one order of magnitude.\nFinally, Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4.6 Curvature and coverage analysis ‣ 4 Evaluation ‣ Meta-Learning with Latent Embedding Optimization\")(c) demonstrates this effect along the specific gradient directions used in the inner loop adaptation: the small gradient steps in 𝐳𝐳{\\\\mathbf{z}} taken by LEO induce much larger steps in θ𝜃\\\\theta space, larger than the gradient steps taken by Meta-SGD in θ𝜃\\\\theta space directly.\nThus, the results support the intuition that LEO is able to ‘transport’ models further during adaptation by performing meta-learning in the latent space.\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 5: Curvature and coverage metrics for a number of different models, computed over 100010001000 problem instances drawn uniformly from the test meta-set.

Most approaches only focus on a specific system and train on past data in order to predict the future. Thus, a new model must be trained to predict a system with different dynamics. Consider, for example, learning fluid dynamics; shown in Fig. [1]Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") are two fluid flows with different degrees of turbulence. Although the flows are governed by the same equations, the difference in buoyant forces would require two separate deep learning models to forecast. Therefore, it is imperative to develop generalizable deep learning models for dynamical systems that can learn and predict well over a large heterogeneous domain.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Meta-learning dynamic forecasting on turbulent flow. The model needs to generalize to a flow with a very different buoyant force.\n\nMeta-learning \\[ [63]), [7]), [13])\\], or learning to learn, improves generalization by learning multiple tasks from the environment. Recent developments in meta-learning have been successfully applied to few-shot classification \\[ [46]), [62])\\], active learning \\[ [77])\\], and reinforcement learning \\[ [18]), [20])\\]. However, meta-learning in the context of forecasting high-dimensional physical dynamics has not been studied before. The challenges with meta-learning dynamical systems are unique in that (1) we need to efficiently infer the latent representation of the dynamical system given observed time series data, (2) we need to account for changes in unknown initial and boundary conditions, and (3) we need to model the temporal dynamics across heterogeneous domains.\n\nOur approach is inspired by the fact that similar dynamical systems may share time-invariant hidden features. Even the slightest change in these features may lead to vastly different phenomena. For example, in climate science, fluids are governed by a set of differential equations called Navier-Stokes equations. Some features such as kinematic viscosity and external forces (e.g. gravity), are time-invariant and determine the flow characteristics. By inferring this latent representation, we can model diverse system behaviors from smoothly flowing water to atmospheric turbulence.\n\nInspired by neural style transfer \\[ [26])\\], we propose a model-based meta-learning method, called DyAd, which can rapidly adapt to systems with varying dynamics. DyAd has two parts, an encoder g𝑔g and a forecaster f𝑓f.\nThe encoder maps different dynamical systems to time-invariant hidden features representing constants of motion, boundary conditions, and external forces which characterize the system.\nThe forecaster f𝑓f then takes the learnt hidden features from the encoder and the past system states to forecast the future system state. Controlled by the time-invariant hidden features, the forecaster has the flexibility to adapt to a wide range of systems with heterogeneous dynamics.\n\nUnlike gradient-based meta-learning techniques such as MAML \\[ [13])\\], DyAd automatically adapts during inference using an encoder and does not require retraining. Similar to model-based meta-learning methods such as MetaNets \\[ [46])\\], we employ a two-part design with an adaptable learner which receives task-specific weights. However, for time-series forecasting, since input and output come from the same domain, a support set of labeled data is unnecessary to define the task. The encoder can infer the task directly from the query input.\n\nOur contributions include:\n\n- •\n\n\nA novel model-based meta-learning method (DyAd) for dynamic forecasting in a large heterogeneous domain.\n\n- •\n\n\nAn encoder capable of extracting the time-invariant hidden features of a dynamical system using time-shift invariant model structure and weak supervision.\n\n- •\n\n\nA new adaptive padding layer (AdaPad), designed for adapting to boundary conditions.\n\n- •\n\n\nTheoretical guarantees for DyAd on the generalization error of task inference in the source domain as well as domain adaptation to the target domain.\n\n- •\n\n\nImproved generalization performance on heterogeneous domains such as fluid flow and sea temperature forecasting, even to new tasks outside the training distribution.",

The problem of dynamics forecasting is that given a sequence of past states (𝐱1,…,𝐱t)subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑡({\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{1},\\\\dots,{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{t}), we want to learn a map f𝑓f such that: f:(𝐱1,…,𝐱t)⟼(𝐱t+1,…​𝐱t+k).:𝑓⟼subscript𝐱1…subscript𝐱𝑡subscript𝐱𝑡1…subscript𝐱𝑡𝑘f:({\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{1},\\\\dots,{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{t})\\\\longmapsto({\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{t+1},\\\\dots\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t+k}).\n\nHere l𝑙l is the length of the input series, and hℎh is the forecasting horizon in the output. Existing approaches for dynamics forecasting only predict future data for a specific system as a single task. Here a task refers to forecasting for a specific system with a given set of parameters. The resulting models often generalize poorly to different system dynamics. Thus a new model must be trained to predict for each specific system.\n\nTo perform meta-learning, we identify each forecasting task by some parameters c⊂ψ𝑐𝜓c\\\\subset\\\\psi, such as constants of motion, external forces, and boundary conditions. We learn multiple tasks simultaneously and infer the task from data. Here we use c𝑐c for a subset of system parameters ψ𝜓\\\\psi, because we usually do not have the full knowledge of the system dynamics.\nIn the turbulent flow example, the state 𝐱tsubscript𝐱𝑡{\\\\mathbf{x}}\\_{t} is the velocity field at time t𝑡t.\nParameters c𝑐c can represent Reynolds number, mean vorticity, mean magnitude, or a vector of all three.\n\nLet μ𝜇\\\\mu be the data distribution over 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y} representing the function f:𝒳→𝒴:𝑓→𝒳𝒴f\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{Y} where 𝒳=ℝd×t𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑𝑡\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times t} and 𝒴=ℝd×k𝒴superscriptℝ𝑑𝑘\\\\mathcal{Y}=\\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times k}.

The data in the same task share the same set of parameters. Let μcsubscript𝜇𝑐\\\\mu\\_{c} be the conditional distribution over 𝒳c×𝒴subscript𝒳𝑐𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\_{c}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y} for task c𝑐c.\n\nDuring training, the model is presented with data drawn from a subset of tasks {(x,y):(x,y)∼μc,c∼C}conditional-set𝑥𝑦formulae-sequencesimilar-to𝑥𝑦subscript𝜇𝑐similar-to𝑐𝐶\\\\{(x,y):(x,y)\\\\sim\\\\mu\\_{c},c\\\\sim C\\\\}.

The encoder infers the time-shift invariant characteristic variable z𝑧z which is used to adapt the forecaster network.\n\n### 2.2 DyAd: Dynamic Adaptation Network\n\nWe propose a model-based meta-learning approach for dynamics forecasting.\nGiven multiple forecasting tasks, we propose to learn the function f𝑓f in two stages. That is, by first inferring the task c𝑐c from the input x𝑥x, and then adapting to a specialized forecaster fc:𝒳c→𝒴:subscript𝑓𝑐→subscript𝒳𝑐𝒴f\\_{c}\\\\colon\\\\mathcal{X}\\_{c}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{Y} for each task. An alternative is to use a single deep neural network to directly model f𝑓f in one step over the whole domain. But this requires the training set to have good and uniform coverage of the different tasks. If the data distribution μ𝜇\\\\mu is highly heterogeneous or the training set is not sampled i.i.d. from the whole domain, then a single model may struggle with generalization.\n\nWe hypothesize that by partitioning the domain into different tasks, the model would learn to pick up task-specific features without requiring uniform coverage of the training data. Furthermore, by separating task inference and forecasting into two stages, we allow the forecaster to rapidly adapt to new tasks that never appeared in the training set.\n\nAs shown in Fig. [2]Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Meta-learning in dynamics forecasting ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\"), our model consists of two parts: an encoder g𝑔g and a forecaster f𝑓f. We introduce zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} as a time-invariant hidden feature for task c𝑐c. We assume that c𝑐c depends linearly on the hidden feature for simplicity and easy interpretation. We design the encoder to infer the hidden feature zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} given the input x𝑥x. We then use zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} to adapt the forecaster f𝑓f to the specific task, i.e., model y=fc​(x)𝑦subscript𝑓𝑐𝑥y=f\\_{c}(x) as y=f​(x,zc)𝑦𝑓𝑥subscript𝑧𝑐y=f(x,z\\_{c}). As the system dynamics are encoded in the input sequence x𝑥x, we can feed the same input sequence x𝑥x to a forecaster and generate predictions y^=fc​(x)^𝑦subscript𝑓𝑐𝑥\\\\hat{y}=f\\_{c}(x).\n\n### 2.3 Encoder Network\n\nThe encoder maps the input x𝑥x to the hidden features zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} that are time-invariant. To enforce this inductive bias, we encode time-invariance both in the architecture and in the training objective.\n\nTime-Invariant Encoder.\nThe encoder is implemented using 4 Conv 3D layers, each followed by BatchNorm, LeakyReLU, and max-pooling. Note that theoretically, max-pooling is not perfectly shift invariant since 2x2x2 max-pooling is equivariant to shifts of size 222 and only approximately invariant to shifts of size 1. But standard convolutional architectures often include max-pooling layers to boost performance. We convolve both across spatial and temporal dimensions.\n\nAfter that, we use a global mean-pooling layer and a fully connected layer to estimate the hidden feature z^csubscript^𝑧𝑐\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}. The task parameter depends linearly on the hidden feature. We use a fully connected layer to compute the parameter estimate c^^𝑐\\\\hat{c}.\n\nSince convolutions are equivariant to shift (up to boundary frames) and mean pooling is invariant to shift, the encoder is shift-invariant. In practice, shifting the time sequence one frame forward will add one new frame at the beginning and drop one frame at the end. This creates some change in output value of the encoder. Thus, practically, the encoder is only approximately shift-invariant.\n\nEncoder Training.\nThe encoder network g𝑔g is trained first. To combat the loss of shift invariance from the change from the boundary frames, we train the encoder using a time-invariant loss. Given two training samples (x(i),y(i))superscript𝑥𝑖superscript𝑦𝑖(x^{(i)},y^{(i)}) and (x(j),y(j))superscript𝑥𝑗superscript𝑦𝑗(x^{(j)},y^{(j)}) and their task parameters c𝑐c, we have loss\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ℒ𝚎𝚗𝚌=∑c∼𝒞‖c^−c‖2+α​∑i,j,c‖z^c(i)−z^c(j)‖2+β​∑i,c‖‖z^c(i)‖2−m‖2subscriptℒ𝚎𝚗𝚌subscriptsimilar-to𝑐𝒞superscriptnorm^𝑐𝑐2𝛼subscript𝑖𝑗𝑐superscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖superscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑗2𝛽subscript𝑖𝑐superscriptnormsuperscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖2𝑚2\\\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\\\mathtt{enc}}=\\\\sum\\_{c\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{C}}\\\\\\|\\\\hat{c}-c\\\\\\|^{2}+\\\\alpha\\\\sum\\_{i,j,c}\\\\\\|\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)}-\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(j)}\\\\\\|^{2}+\\\\beta\\\\sum\\_{i,c}\\\\\\|\\\\\\|\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)}\\\\\\|^{2}-m\\\\\\|^{2}\\\\vspace{-7pt} |  | (1) |\n\nwhere z^(i)=g​(x(i))superscript^𝑧𝑖𝑔superscript𝑥𝑖\\\\hat{z}^{(i)}=g(x^{(i)}) and z^(j)=g​(x(j))superscript^𝑧𝑗𝑔superscript𝑥𝑗\\\\hat{z}^{(j)}=g(x^{(j)}) and c^(i)=W​z^c(i)+bsuperscript^𝑐𝑖𝑊superscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖𝑏\\\\hat{c}^{(i)}=W\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)}+b is an affine transformation of zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c}.\n\nThe first term ‖c^−c‖2superscriptnorm^𝑐𝑐2\\\\\\|\\\\hat{c}-c\\\\\\|^{2} uses weak supervision of the task parameters whenever they are available.

For example, instead of the Reynolds number of the fluid flow, we can use the average vorticity as a surrogate for task parameters.\n\nThe second term ‖z^c(i)−z^c(j)‖2superscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖superscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑗2\\\\\\|\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)}-\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(j)}\\\\\\|^{2} is the time-shift invariance loss, which penalizes the changes in latent variables between samples from different time steps. Since the time-shift invariance of convolution is only approximate, this loss term drives the time-shift error even lower. The third term \\|‖z^c(i)‖−m\\|2superscriptnormsuperscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖𝑚2\\|\\\\\\|\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)}\\\\\\|-m\\|^{2} (m𝑚m is a positive value) prevents the encoder from generating small z^c(i)superscriptsubscript^𝑧𝑐𝑖\\\\hat{z}\\_{c}^{(i)} due to time-shift invariance loss. It also helps the encoder to learn more interesting z𝑧z, even in the absence of weak supervision.\n\nHidden Features.\nThe encoder learns time-invariant hidden features. These hidden features resemble the time-invariant dimensionless parameters \\[ [30])\\] in physical modeling, such as Reynolds number in fluid mechanics.\n\nThe hidden features may also be viewed as partial disentanglement of the system state. As suggested by \\[ [37]), [47])\\], our disentanglement method is guided by inductive bias and training objectives. Unlike complete disentanglement, as in e.g. \\[ [39])\\], in which the latent representation is factored into time-invariant and time-varying components, we focus only on time-shift-invariance.\n\nNonetheless, the hidden features can control the forecaster which is useful for generalization.\n\n### 2.4 Forecaster Network.\n\nThe forecaster incorporates the hidden feature zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} from the encoder and adapts to the specific forecasting task fc=f​(⋅,zc)subscript𝑓𝑐𝑓⋅subscript𝑧𝑐f\\_{c}=f(\\\\cdot,z\\_{c}). In what follows, we use z𝑧z for zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c}.\nWe use two specialized layers, adaptive instance normalization (AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN}) and adaptive padding (AdaPadAdaPad\\\\mathrm{AdaPad}).\nAdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN} has been used in neural style transfer \\[ [26]), [21])\\] to control generative networks. Here, AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN} may adapt for specific coefficients and external forces. We also introduce a new layer, AdaPad​(x,z)AdaPad𝑥𝑧\\\\mathrm{AdaPad}(x,z), which is designed for encoding the boundary conditions of dynamical systems. The backbone of the forecaster network can be any sequence prediction model. We use a design that is similar to ResNet for spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Illustration of the AdaPad operation.\n\n#### AdaIN.\n\nWe employ AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN} to adapt the forecaster network. Denote the channels of input x𝑥x by xisubscript𝑥𝑖x\\_{i} and let μ​(xi)𝜇subscript𝑥𝑖\\\\mu(x\\_{i}) and σ​(xi)𝜎subscript𝑥𝑖\\\\sigma(x\\_{i}) be the mean and standard deviation of channel i𝑖i. For each AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN} layer, a particular style is computed s=(μi,σi)i=A​z+b𝑠subscriptsubscript𝜇𝑖subscript𝜎𝑖𝑖𝐴𝑧𝑏s=(\\\\mu\\_{i},\\\\sigma\\_{i})\\_{i}=Az+b, where the linear map A𝐴A and bias b𝑏b are learned weights. Adaptive instance normalization is then defined as yi=σi​xi−μ​(xi)σ​(xi)+μi.subscript𝑦𝑖subscript𝜎𝑖subscript𝑥𝑖𝜇subscript𝑥𝑖𝜎subscript𝑥𝑖subscript𝜇𝑖y\\_{i}=\\\\sigma\\_{i}\\\\frac{x\\_{i}-\\\\mu(x\\_{i})}{\\\\sigma(x\\_{i})}+\\\\mu\\_{i}.\nIn essence, the channels are renormalized to the style s𝑠s.\n\nFor dynamics forecasting, the hidden feature z𝑧z encodes data analogous to the coefficients of a differential equation and external forces on the system. In numerical simulation of a differential equation these coefficients enter as scalings of different terms in the equation and the external forces are added to the combined force equation \\[ [24])\\]. Thus in our context AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN}, which scales channels and adds a global vector, is well-suited to injecting this information.\n\n#### AdaPad.\n\nTo complement AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN}, we introduce AdaPadAdaPad\\\\mathrm{AdaPad}, which encodes the boundary conditions of each specific dynamical system. Generally when predicting dynamical systems, error is introduced along the boundaries since it is unknown how the dynamics interact with the boundary of the domain, and there may be unknown inflows or outflows. In our method, the inferred hidden feature z𝑧z may contain the boundary information. AdaPadAdaPad\\\\mathrm{AdaPad} uses the hidden features to compute the boundary conditions via a linear layer. Then it applies the boundary conditions as padding immediately outside the spatial domain in each layer, as shown in Fig. [3]Figure 3 ‣ 2.4 Forecaster Network. ‣ 2 Methods ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\").\n\n#### Forecaster Training\n\nThe forecaster is trained separately after the encoder. The kernels of the convolutions and the mappings of the AdaINAdaIN\\\\mathrm{AdaIN} and AdaPadAdaPad\\\\mathrm{AdaPad} layers are all trained simultaneously as the forecaster network is trained. Denote the true state as y𝑦y and the predicted state as y^^𝑦\\\\hat{y}, we compute the loss per time step ‖y^−y‖2superscriptnorm^𝑦𝑦2\\\\\\|\\\\hat{y}-y\\\\\\|^{2} for each example. We accumulate the loss over different time steps and generate multi-step forecasts in an autoregressive fashion. In practice, we observe separate training achieves better performances than training end-to-end, see experiments for details.\n\n### 2.5 Theoretical Analysis\n\nThe high-level idea of our method is to learn a good representation of the dynamics that generalizes well across a heterogeneous domain, and then adapt this representation to make predictions on new tasks. Our model achieves this by learning on multiple tasks simultaneously and then adapting to new tasks with domain transfer. We prove that learning the tasks simultaneously as opposed to independently results in better generalization (Proposition [B.3]Proposition B.3. ‣ B.1 Multi-Task Learning Error ‣ Appendix B Theoretical Analysis ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") in Appendix). We also provide a theoretical decomposition for the generalization error.\n\nSpecifically, our hypothesis space has the form {x↦fθ​(x,gϕ​(x))}maps-to𝑥subscript𝑓𝜃𝑥subscript𝑔italic-ϕ𝑥\\\\{x\\\\mapsto f\\_{\\\\theta}(x,g\\_{\\\\phi}(x))\\\\} where ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi and θ𝜃\\\\theta are the weights of the encoder and forecaster respectively.

W1subscript𝑊1W\\_{1} denotes the Wasserstein distance between tasks. R​(𝒢)𝑅𝒢R(\\\\mathcal{G}) and R​(ℱ)𝑅ℱR(\\\\mathcal{F}) represent the Rademacher complexities of encoder and forecaster.

            "content": "Learning Dynamical Systems.\nDeep learning models are gaining popularity for learning dynamical systems \\[ [60]), [8]), [29]), [5]), [73]), [64]), [51])\\]. An emerging topic is physics-informed deep learning \\[ [53]), [6]), [11]), [69]), [4]), [3]), [68]), [12]), [10])\\] which integrates inductive biases from physical systems to improve learning. For example, \\[ [45]), [6])\\] incorporated Koopman theory into the architecture. \\[ [43])\\] used deep neural networks to solve PDEs with physical laws enforced in the loss functions. \\[ [17])\\] and \\[ [9])\\] build models upon Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics that respect conservation laws. \\[ [68])\\] proposed a hybrid approach by marrying two well-established turbulent flow simulation techniques with deep learning to produce a better prediction of turbulence. \\[ [10])\\] propose a physics-informed GAN architecture that uses physics knowledge to inform the learning of both the generator and discriminator models. However, these approaches deal with a specific system dynamics instead of a large heterogeneous domain.\n\nMulti-task learning and Meta-learning.\nMulti-task learning \\[ [65])\\] focuses on learning shared representations from multiple related tasks. Architecture-based MTL methods can be categorized into encoder-focused \\[ [35])\\] and decoder-focused \\[ [74])\\]. There are also optimization-based MTL methods, such as task balancing methods \\[ [27])\\]. But MTL assumes tasks are known a priori instead of inferring the task from data.\nOn the other hand, the aim of meta-learning \\[ [63])\\] is to leverage the shared representation to fast adapt to unseen tasks. Based on how the meta-level knowledge is extracted and used, meta-learning methods are classified into model-based \\[ [46]), [1]), [50]), [59]), [78])\\], metric-based \\[ [67]), [61])\\] and gradient-based \\[ [13]), [57]), [16]), [76])\\]. Most meta-learning approaches are not designed for forecasting with a few exceptions. \\[ [72])\\] proposed to train a domain classifier with weak supervision to help domain adaptation but focused on low-dimensioal time series classification problems. \\[ [50])\\] designed a residual architecture for time series forecasting with a meta-learning parallel. \\[ [1])\\] proposed a modular meta-learning approach for continuous control. But forecasting physical dynamics poses unique challenges to meta-learning as it requires encoding physical knowledge into our model.\n\nStyle Transfer.\nOur approach is inspired by neural style transfer techniques. In style transfer, a generative network is controlled by an external style vector through adaptive instance normalization between convolutional layers. Our hidden representation bears affinity with the “style” vector in style transfer techniques. Rather than aesthetic style in images, our hidden representation encodes time-invariant features. Style transfer initially appear in non-photorealistic rendering \\[ [31])\\]. Recently, neural style transfer \\[ [25])\\] has been applied to image synthesis \\[ [15]), [36])\\], videos generation \\[ [56])\\], and language translation \\[ [52])\\]. For dynamical systems, \\[ [58])\\] adapts texture synthesis to transfer the style of turbulence for animation. \\[ [28])\\] studies unsupervised generative modeling of turbulent flows but for super-resolution reconstruction rather than forecasting.\n\nVideo Prediction.\nOur work is also related to video prediction. Conditioning on the historic observed frames, video prediction models are trained to predict future frames, e.g., \\[ [41]), [14]), [75]), [66]), [49]), [14]), [70]), [71]), [32]), [40]), [34])\\]. There is also conditional video prediction \\[ [48])\\] which achieves controlled synthesis. Many of these models are trained on natural videos from unknown physical processes. Our work is substantially different because we do not attempt to predict object or camera motions. However, our method can be potentially combined with video prediction models to improve generalization.",

These are difficult to forecast using numerical methods due to unknown external forces and complex dynamics not fully captured by simplified mathematical models.\n\nTurbulent Flow with Varying Buoyancy. We generate a synthetic dataset of turbulent flows with a numerical simulator, PhiFlow111 [https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow]. It contains 64×\\\\times64 velocity fields of turbulent flows in which we vary the buoyant force acting on the fluid from 1 to 25. Each buoyant force corresponds to a forecasting task and there are 25 tasks in total. We use the mean vorticity of each task as partial supervision c𝑐c as we can directly calculate it from the data. Vorticity can characterize formation and circular motion of turbulent flows.\n\nSea Surface Temperature. We evaluate on a real-world sea surface temperature data generated by the NEMO ocean engine \\[ [38])\\]222The data are available at [https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com\\_csw&view=details&product\\_id=GLOBAL\\_ANALYSIS\\_FORECAST\\_PHY\\_001\\_024]. We select an area from Pacific ocean range from 01/01/2018 to 12/31/2020. The corresponding latitude and longitude are (-150∼similar-to\\\\sim-120, -20∼similar-to\\\\sim-50). This area is then divided into 25 64×\\\\times64 subregions, each is a task since the mean temperature varies a lot along longitude and latitude. For the encoder training, we use season as an additional supervision signal besides the mean temperature of each subregion. In other words, the encoder should be able to infer the mean temperature of the subregion as well as to classify four seasons given the temperature series.\n\nOcean Currents. We also experiment with the velocity fields of ocean currents from the same region and use the same task division as the sea surface temperature data set. Similar to the turbulent flow data set, we use the mean vorticity of each subregion as the weak-supervision signal.\n\n### 4.2 Baselines\n\nWe include several SoTA baselines from meta-learning and dynamics forecasting.\n\n- •\n\n\nResNet\\[ [19])\\]: A widely adopted video prediction model \\[ [69])\\].\n\n- •\n\n\nU-net\\[ [55])\\]: Originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, adapted for dynamics forecasting \\[ [11])\\].\n\n- •\n\n\nResNet/Unet-c: Above ResNet and Unet with an additional final layer that generates task parameter c𝑐c and trained with weak-supervision and forecasting loss altogether.\n\n- •\n\n\nPredRNN\\[ [70])\\]: A state-of-art RNNs-based spatiotemporal forecasting model.\n\n- •\n\n\nVarSepNet\\[ [12])\\]: A convolutional dynamics forecasting model based on spatiotemporal disentanglement.\n\n- •\n\n\nMod-attn\\[ [1])\\]: A modular meta-learning method which combines the outputs of modules to generalize to new tasks using attention.\n\n- •\n\n\nMod-wt: A modular meta-learning variant which uses attention weights to combine the parameters of the convolutional kernels in different modules for new tasks.\n\n- •\n\n\nMetaNet\\[ [46])\\]: A model-based meta-learning method which requires a few samples from test tasks as a support set to adapt.\n\n- •\n\n\nMAML\\[ [13])\\]: A optimization-based meta-learning approach. We replaced the original classifier with a ResNet for regression.\n\n\nNote that both ResNet-c and Unet-c have access to task parameters c𝑐c. Modular-attn has a convolutional encoder f𝑓f that takes the same input x𝑥x as each module M𝑀M to generate attention weights, ∑l=1mexp⁡\\[f​(x)​(l)\\]∑k=1mexp⁡\\[f​(x)​(k)\\]​Ml​(x)superscriptsubscript𝑙1𝑚𝑓𝑥𝑙superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝑚𝑓𝑥𝑘subscript𝑀𝑙𝑥\\\\sum\\_{l=1}^{m}\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\[f(x)(l)\\]}{\\\\sum\\_{k=1}^{m}\\\\exp\\[f(x)(k)\\]}M\\_{l}(x). Modular-wt also has the same encoder but to generate weights for combining the convolution parameters of all modules. MetaNet requires samples from test tasks as a support set and MAML needs adaptation retraining on test tasks, while other models do not need any information from the test domains. Thus, we use additional samples of up to 20% of the test set from test tasks. MetaNet uses these as a support set. MAML is retrained on these samples for 10 epoch for adaptation. To demonstrate the generalizability of DyAd, we experimented with ResNet and U-net as our forecaster.\n\n### 4.3 Experiments Setup\n\nFor all datasets, we use a sliding-window approach to generate samples of sequences. We evaluate on two scenarios of generalization. For test-future, we train and test on the same task but different time steps. For test-domain, we train and test on different tasks with an 80-20 split. All models are trained to make next step prediction given the history. We forecast in an autoregressive manner to generate multi-step ahead predictions. All results are averaged over 3 runs with random initialization.\n\nApart from the root mean square error (RMSE), we also report the energy spectrum error (ESE) for ocean current prediction, which quantifies the physical consistency. ESE indicates whether the predictions preserve the correct statistical distribution and obey the energy conservation law, which is a critical metric for physical consistency.

Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") also reports ESEs on real-world Ocean Currents. DyAd not only has small RMSE but also obtains the smallest ESE, suggesting it captures the statistical distribution of ocean currents well.\n\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") shows the target and the predicted velocity norm fields (u2+v2superscript𝑢2superscript𝑣2\\\\sqrt{u^{2}+v^{2}}) by Unet-c, Modular-wt and DyAd at time step 1, 5, 10 for Turbulent Flows with buoyancy factors 9 and 21 respectively. We can see that DyAd can generate realistic flows with the corresponding characteristics while the baselines have trouble understanding and disentangling the buoyancy factor. Figure [2]Table 2 ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Experiments Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") shows DyAd, ResNet, U-net, PredRNN predictions on an ocean current sample in the future test set, and we see the shape of predictions by DyAd is closest to the target. These results demonstrate that DyAd not only forecasts well but also accurately captures the physical characteristics of the system.\n\n### 5.2 Controllable Forecast.\n\nDyAd infers the hidden features from data, which allows direct control of the latent space in the forecaster. We vary the encoder input while keeping the forecaster input fixed. Figure [6]Figure 6 ‣ 4.3 Experiments Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") right shows the forecasts from DyAd when the encoder is fed with flows having different buoyancy factors c=5,15,25𝑐51525c=5,15,25. As expected, with higher buoyancy factors, the predictions from the forecaster become more turbulent. This demonstrates that the encoder can successfully disentangle the latent representation of difference tasks, and control the predictions of the forecaster.\n\n### 5.3 Ablation Study.\n\nWe performed several ablation studies of DyAd on the turbulence dataset to understand the contribution of each model component.\n\nAblation of the Model and Training Strategy.\nWe first performed ablation study of the model architecture, shown in Table [2]Table 2 ‣ Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Experiments Setup ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\"). We first remove the encoder from DyAd while keeping the same forecaster network (No\\_enc). The resulting model degrades but still outperforms ResNet. This demonstrates the effectiveness of AdaIN and AdaPad for forecasting. We also tested DyAd with AdaIN only (No\\_AdaPad), and the performance without AdaPad was slightly worse.\n\nAnother notable feature of our model is the ability to infer tasks with weakly supervised signals c𝑐c. It is important to have a c𝑐c that is related to the task domain. As an ablative study, we fed the encoder in DyAd with a random c𝑐c, leading to Wrong\\_enc. We can see that having the totally wrong supervision may slightly hurt the forecasting performance. We also trained the encoder and the forecaster in DyAd altogether (End2End) but observed worse performance. This validates our hypothesis about the significance of domain partitioning and separate training strategy.\n\nAblation of Encoder Training Losses.\nWe performed an ablation study of three training loss terms for the encoder to show the necessity of each loss term, shown in Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 5.3 Ablation Study. ‣ 5 Results ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\") We tried training the encoder only with the supervision of task parameters (Sup\\_c). We also tested training with the first two terms but without the magnitude loss (Sup\\_c+time\\_inv). We can see that missing any of three loss terms would make the encoder fail to learn the correct task-specific and time-invariant features.\n\nAlternatives to AdaIN.\nWe also tested 5 different alternatives to AdaIN for injecting the hidden feature zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} into the forecaster, and reported the results in Table [4]Table 4 ‣ 5.3 Ablation Study. ‣ 5 Results ‣ Meta-Learning Dynamics Forecasting Using Task Inference\"). We tested concatenating zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} to the input of the forecaster, using zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} as the kernels of the forecaster, concatenating zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} to the hidden states, adding zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} to the hidden states, using zcsubscript𝑧𝑐z\\_{c} as the biases in the convolutional layers in the forecaster. AdaIN worked better than any alternative we tested.\n\n| Model | future | domain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DyAd (ours) | 0.42 | 0.51 |\n| Sup\\_c | 0.53 | 0.56 |\n| Sup\\_c+time\\_inv | 0.51 | 0.54 |\n\nTable 3: Ablation study of the encoder training loss terms.

            "content": "Data-driven approaches offer an interesting alternative and complement to physical-based methods for modeling the dynamics of complex systems and are particularly promising in a wide range of settings: e.g. if the underlying dynamics are partially known or understood, if the physical model is incomplete, inaccurate, or fails to adapt to different contexts, or if external perturbation sources and forces are not modeled. The idea of deploying machine learning (ML) to model complex dynamical systems picked momentum a few years ago, relying on recent deep learning progresses and on the development of new methods targeting the evolution of temporal and spatiotemporal systems \\[ [6]), [9]), [7]), [21]), [30]), [2]), [37])\\]. It is already being applied in different scientific disciplines (see e.g. \\[ [36])\\] for a recent survey) and could help accelerate scientific discovery to address challenging domains such as climate \\[ [32])\\] or health \\[ [12])\\].\n\nHowever, despite promising results, current developments are limited and usually postulate an idealized setting where data is abundant and the environment does not change, the so-called “i.i.d. hypothesis”. In practice, real-world data may be expensive or difficult to acquire. Moreover, changes in the environment may be caused by many different factors. For example, in climate modeling, there are external forces (e.g. Coriolis) which depend on the spatial location \\[ [23])\\]; or, in health science, parameters need to be personalized for each patient as for cardiac computational models \\[ [27])\\]. More generally, data acquisition and modeling are affected by different factors such as geographical position, sensor variability, measuring circumstances, etc. The classical paradigm either considers all the data as i.i.d. and looks for a global model, or proposes specific models for each environment. The former disregards discrepancies between the environments, thus leading to a biased solution with an averaged model which will usually perform poorly. The latter ignores the similarities between environments, thus affecting generalization performance, particularly in settings where per-environment data is limited.\nThis is particularly problematic in dynamical settings, as small changes in initial conditions lead to trajectories not covered by the training data.\n\nIn this work, we consider a setting where it is explicitly assumed that the trajectories are collected from different environments. Note that in this setting, the i.i.d. hypothesis is removed twice: by considering the temporality of the data and by the existence of multiple environments. In many useful contexts the dynamics in each environment share similarities, while being distinct which translates into changes in the data distributions. Our objective is to leverage the similarities between environments in order to improve the modeling capacity and generalization performance, while still carefully dealing with the discrepancies across environments. This brings us to consider two research questions:\n\nRQ1\n\nDoes modeling the differences between environments improve generalization error w.r.t. classical settings: One-For-All, where a unique function is trained for all environments; and One-Per-Env., where a specific function is fitted for each environment? (cf. Sec. [4]Experiments ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") for more details)\n\nRQ2\n\nIs it possible to extrapolate to a novel environment that has not been seen during training?\n\nWe propose LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), a novel learning methodology decomposing the learned dynamics into shared and environment-specific components. The learning problem is formulated such that the shared component captures the dynamics common across environments and exploits all the available data, while the environment-specific component only models the remaining dynamics, i.e. those that cannot be expressed by the former, based on environment-specific data. We show, under mild conditions, that the learning problem is well-posed, as the resulting decomposition exists and is unique (Sec. [2.2]LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")). We then analyze the properties of this decomposition from a sample complexity perspective. While, in general, the bounds might be too loose to be practical, a more precise study is conducted in the case of linear dynamics for which theory and practice are closer. We then instantiate this framework for more general hypothesis spaces and dynamics, leading to a heuristic for the control of generalization that will be validated experimentally. Overall, we show that this framework provides better generalization properties than One-Per-Env., requiring less training data to reach the same performance level (RQ1). The shared information is also useful to extrapolate to unknown environments: the new function for this environment can be learned from very little data (RQ2). We experiment with these ideas on three representative cases (Sec. [4]Experiments ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")) where the dynamics are provided by differential equations: ODEs with the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, and PDEs with the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion and the more challenging incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Experimental evidence confirms the intuition and the theoretical findings: with a similar amount of data, the approach drastically outperforms One-For-All and One-Per-Env. settings, especially in low data regimes. Up to our knowledge, it is the first time that generalization in multiple dynamical systems is addressed from an ML perspective111Code is available at [https://github.com/yuan-yin/LEADS]..",

            "content": "### 2.1 Problem setting\n\nWe consider the problem of learning models of dynamical physical processes with data acquired from a set of environments E𝐸E. Throughout the paper, we will assume that the dynamics in an environment e∈E𝑒𝐸e\\\\in E are defined through the evolution of differential equations. This will provide in particular a clear setup for the experiments and the validation. For a given problem, we consider that the dynamics of the different environments share common factors while each environments has its own specificity, resulting in a distinct model per environment. Both the general form of the differential equations and the specific terms of each environment are assumed to be completely unknown. xtesubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑡x^{e}\\_{t} denotes the state of the equation for environment e𝑒e, taking its values from a bounded set 𝒜𝒜{\\\\mathcal{A}}, with evolution term fe:𝒜→T​𝒜:subscript𝑓𝑒→𝒜𝑇𝒜f\\_{e}:{\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\to T{\\\\mathcal{A}}, T​𝒜𝑇𝒜T{\\\\mathcal{A}} being the tangent bundle of 𝒜𝒜{\\\\mathcal{A}}. In other words, over a fixed time interval \\[0,T\\]0𝑇\\[0,T\\], we have:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​xted​t=fe​(xte)dsubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑡d𝑡subscript𝑓𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑡\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}x^{e}\\_{t}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=f\\_{e}(x^{e}\\_{t}) |  | (1) |\n\nWe assume that, for any e𝑒e, fesubscript𝑓𝑒f\\_{e} lies in a functional vector space ℱℱ{\\\\mathcal{F}}. In the experiments, we will consider one ODE, in which case 𝒜⊂ℝd𝒜superscriptℝ𝑑{\\\\mathcal{A}}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, and two PDEs, in which case 𝒜𝒜{\\\\mathcal{A}} is a d′superscript𝑑′d^{\\\\prime}-dimensional vector field over a bounded spatial domain S⊂ℝd′𝑆superscriptℝsuperscript𝑑′S\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\\\prime}}. The term of the data-generating dynamical system in Eq. [1]In 2.1 Problem setting ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") is sampled from a distribution for each e𝑒e, i.e. fe∼Qsimilar-tosubscript𝑓𝑒𝑄f\\_{e}\\\\sim Q. From fesubscript𝑓𝑒f\\_{e}, we define 𝒯esubscript𝒯𝑒{\\\\mathcal{T}}\\_{e}, the data distribution of trajectories x⋅esubscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑒⋅x^{e}\\_{\\\\cdot} verifying Eq. [1]In 2.1 Problem setting ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\"), induced by a distribution of initial states x0e∼P0similar-tosuperscriptsubscript𝑥0𝑒subscript𝑃0x\\_{0}^{e}\\\\sim P\\_{0}. The data for this environment is then composed of l𝑙l trajectories sampled from 𝒯esubscript𝒯𝑒{\\\\mathcal{T}}\\_{e}, and is denoted as 𝒯^esubscript^𝒯𝑒\\\\smash{{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}}\\_{e}} with x⋅e,isuperscriptsubscript𝑥⋅𝑒𝑖\\\\smash{x\\_{\\\\cdot}^{e,i}} the i𝑖i-th trajectory. We will denote the full dataset by 𝒯^=⋃e∈E𝒯^e^𝒯subscript𝑒𝐸subscript^𝒯𝑒\\\\smash{{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}}=\\\\bigcup\\_{e\\\\in E}{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}}\\_{e}}.\n\nThe classical empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework suggests to model the data dynamics either at the global level (One-For-All), taking trajectories indiscriminately from 𝒯^^𝒯\\\\smash{{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}}}, or at the specific environment level (One-Per-Env.), training one model for each 𝒯^esubscript^𝒯𝑒\\\\smash{{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}}\\_{e}}. Our aim is to formulate a new learning framework with the objective of explicitly considering the existence of different environments to improve the modeling strategy w.r.t. the classical ERM settings.\n\n### 2.2 LEADS framework\n\nWe decompose the dynamics into two components where f∈ℱ𝑓ℱf\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{F}} is shared across environments and ge∈ℱsubscript𝑔𝑒ℱg\\_{e}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{F}} is specific to the environment e𝑒e, so that\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ∀e∈E,fe=f+geformulae-sequencefor-all𝑒𝐸subscript𝑓𝑒𝑓subscript𝑔𝑒\\\\forall e\\\\in E,f\\_{e}=f+g\\_{e} |  | (2) |\n\nSince we consider functional vector spaces, this additive hypothesis is not restrictive and such a decomposition always exists. It is also quite natural as a sum of evolution terms can be seen as the sum of the forces acting on the system. Note that the sum of two evolution terms can lead to behaviors very different from those induced by each of those terms. However, learning this decomposition from data defines an ill-posed problem: for any choice of f𝑓f, there is a {ge}e∈Esubscriptsubscript𝑔𝑒𝑒𝐸\\\\smash{\\\\{g\\_{e}\\\\}\\_{e\\\\in E}} such that Eq. [2]In 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") is verified. A trivial example would be f=0𝑓0f=0 leading to a solution where each environment is fitted separately.\n\nOur core idea is that f𝑓f should capture as much of the shared dynamics as is possible, while gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e} should focus only on the environment characteristics not captured by f𝑓f. To formalize this intuition, we introduce Ω​(ge)Ωsubscript𝑔𝑒\\\\Omega(g\\_{e}), a penalization on gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e}, which precise definition will depend on the considered setting.\nWe reformulate the learning objective as the following constrained optimization problem:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | minf,{ge}e∈E∈ℱ​∑e∈EΩ​(ge)​subject​to​∀xe,i∈𝒯^,∀t,d​xte,id​t=(f+ge)​(xte,i)formulae-sequencesubscript𝑓subscriptsubscript𝑔𝑒𝑒𝐸ℱsubscript𝑒𝐸Ωsubscript𝑔𝑒subjecttofor-allsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑖^𝒯for-all𝑡dsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑖d𝑡𝑓subscript𝑔𝑒superscriptsubscript𝑥𝑡𝑒𝑖\\\\min\\\\limits\\_{f,\\\\{g\\_{e}\\\\}\\_{e\\\\in E}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{F}}}~{}~{}~{}\\\\sum\\_{e\\\\in E}\\\\Omega(g\\_{e})~{}~{}~{}\\\\mathrm{subject~{}to}~{}~{}~{}\\\\forall x^{e,i}\\\\in{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{T}}},\\\\forall t,\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}x\\_{t}^{e,i}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=(f+g\\_{e})(x\\_{t}^{e,i}) |  | (3) |\n\nMinimizing ΩΩ\\\\Omega aims to reduce gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e}s’ complexity while correctly fitting the dynamics of each environment. This argument will be made formal in the next section. Note that f𝑓f will be trained on the data from all environments contrary to gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e}s.\nA key question is then to determine under which conditions the minimum in Eq. [3]In 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") is well-defined. The following proposition provides an answer (proof cf. Sup. [A]Appendix A Proof of Proposition 1 ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")):\n\n###### Proposition 1(Existence and Uniqueness).\n\nAssume ΩΩ\\\\Omega is convex, then the existence of a minimal decomposition f⋆,{ge⋆}e∈E∈ℱsuperscript𝑓⋆subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑔⋆𝑒𝑒𝐸ℱ\\\\smash{{f^{\\\\star},\\\\{g^{\\\\star}\\_{e}\\\\}\\_{e\\\\in E}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{F}}}} of Eq. [3]In 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") is guaranteed. Furthermore, if ΩΩ\\\\Omega is strictly convex, this decomposition is unique.\n\nIn practice, we consider the following relaxed formulation of Eq.

This then allows us to construct an appropriate ΩΩ\\\\Omega for NNs.\n\n### 3.1 General case\n\nAfter introducing preliminary notations and definitions, we define the hypothesis spaces associated with our multiple environment framework. Considering a first setting where all environments of interest are present at training time, we prove an upper-bound of their effective size based on the covering numbers of the approximation spaces. This allows us to quantitatively control the sample complexity of our model, depending on the number of environments m𝑚m and other quantities that can be considered and optimized in practice.

To see this, suppose that we have two situations corresponding to data generated respectively from m𝑚m and m/b𝑚𝑏m/b environments.

We can then easily control the number of data points and environments in experiments by taking different subsets. The second one is used to validate the improvement with LEADS while training on novel environments. We simulate 1 trajectory (n=1⋅K𝑛⋅1𝐾n\\\\!=\\\\!1\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!K data points) for training. We create two datasets for further validation of LEADS with GS and NS. For GS, we simulate trajectories of K=10𝐾10K\\\\!=\\\\!10 steps with Δ​t=40Δ𝑡40\\\\Delta t\\\\!=\\\\!40. We choose 3 parameters and simulate 1 trajectory (n=1⋅K𝑛⋅1𝐾n\\\\!=\\\\!1\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!K data points) for training. For NS, we simulate trajectories of K=10𝐾10K\\\\!=\\\\!10 steps with Δ​t=1Δ𝑡1\\\\Delta t\\\\!=\\\\!1. We choose 4 forcing terms and simulate 8 trajectories (n=8⋅K𝑛⋅8𝐾n\\\\!=\\\\!8\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!K states) for training. For test-time evaluation, we create for each equation in each environment a test set of 32 trajectories (32⋅K⋅32𝐾32\\\\!\\\\cdot\\\\!K) data points. Note that every environment dataset has the same number of trajectories and the initial conditions are fixed to equal values across the environments to ensure that the data variations only come from the dynamics themselves, i.e. for the i𝑖i-th trajectory in 𝒫^esubscript^𝒫𝑒\\\\smash{{\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}}\\_{e}}, ∀e,x0e,i=x0ifor-all𝑒subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑒𝑖0subscriptsuperscript𝑥𝑖0\\\\smash{\\\\forall e,x^{e,i}\\_{0}\\\\!=\\\\!x^{i}\\_{0}}.

Instead of being encoded in a separate function gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e} like in LEADS, the environment appears here as an extra one-hot input for the RNN linear transformations. This can be implemented for representative SOTA (spatio-)temporal predictors such as GRU \\[ [8])\\] or PredRNN \\[ [35])\\].\n(d)FT-NODE: a baseline for which the same environment encoding as FT-RNN is incorporated in a Neural ODE \\[ [7])\\].\n(e)Gradient-based Meta Learning or GBML-like method: we propose a GBML-like baseline which can directly compare to our framework.

For LV systems, we confirm first that the entire dataset cannot be learned properly with a single model (One-For-All) when the number of environments increases. Comparing with other baselines, our method LEADS reduces the test MSE over 85% w.r.t. One-Per-Env. and over 60% w.r.t. LEADSno min., we also cut 50%-75% of error w.r.t. other baselines.

We observe the same tendency for the GS and NS systems. The error is reduced by: around 2/3 (GS) and 45% (NS) w.r.t. One-Per-Env.; over 60% (GS) and 15% (NS) w.r.t.

In Fig. [2a]Figure 2 ‣ Datasets. ‣ 4.1 Dynamics, environments, and datasets ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\"), the final states obtained with LEADS are qualitatively closer to the ground truth. Looking at the error maps on the right, we see that the errors are systematically reduced across all environments compared to the baselines.

We apply the models in 1 to 8 environments. 4 groups of curves correspond to models trained with 1 to 8 trajectories per env.

More results of baselines methods in Sup. [D]Appendix D Additional experimental details ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\").\n\nWe have also conducted a larger scale experiment on LV (Fig. [4.3]All environments available at once. ‣ 4.3 Experimental results ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")) to analyze the behavior of the different training approaches as the number of environments increases. We consider three models One-For-All, One-Per-Env. and LEADS, 1, 2, 4 and 8 environments, and for each such case, we have 4 groups of curves, corresponding to 1, 2, 4 and 8 training trajectories per environment. We summarize the main observations. With One-For-All (blue), the error increases as the number of environments increases: the dynamics for each environment being indeed different, this introduces an increasingly large bias, and thus the data cannot be fit with one single model. The performance of One-Per-Env. (in red), for which models are trained independently for each environment, is constant as expected when the number of environments changes. LEADS (green) circumvents these issues and shows that the shared characteristics among the environments can be leveraged so as to improve generalization: it is particularly effective when the number of samples per environment is small.\n(See Sup. [D]Appendix D Additional experimental details ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") for more details on the experiments and on the results).\n\n{wrapfloat}\n\nfigurer0.55\n\n![[Uncaptioned image]]Test error evolution during training on 2 novel environments for LV.\n\n##### Learning on novel environments.\n\nWe demonstrate how the pre-trained dynamics can help to fit a model for novel environments. We took an f𝑓f pre-trained by LEADS on a set of LV environments.

Pre-trained-f𝑓f-Only alone cannot predict in any novel environments. Very fast in the training stages, Pre-trained-f𝑓f-Plus-Trained-gesubscript𝑔𝑒g\\_{e} already surpasses the best error of the model trained from scratch (indicated with dotted line). Similar results are also observed with the GS and NS datasets (cf. Sup. [D]Appendix D Additional experimental details ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\"), Table [S5]Table S5 ‣ Learning in novel environments ‣ D.4 Additional experimental results ‣ Appendix D Additional experimental details ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")). These empirical results clearly show that the learned shared dynamics accelerates and improves the learning in novel environments.\n\n### 4.4 Training and implementation details\n\n##### Discussion on trajectory-based optimization.\n\nSolving the learning problem Eq. [2]In 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\") in our setting, involves computing a trajectory loss (integral term in Eq. [4]In 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")).

This is not the best solution and we have observed much better prediction performance for all models, including the baselines, when computing the error directly on the states, using an integral formulation ∑k=1K‖x(k+1)​Δ​t−x~(k+1)​Δ​t‖2superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾superscriptnormsubscript𝑥𝑘1Δ𝑡subscript~𝑥𝑘1Δ𝑡2{{\\\\sum\\_{k=1}^{K}\\\\\\|x\\_{(k+1)\\\\Delta t}-\\\\tilde{x}\\_{(k+1)\\\\Delta t}\\\\\\|^{2}}}, where x~(k+1)​Δ​tsubscript~𝑥𝑘1Δ𝑡\\\\tilde{x}\\_{(k+1)\\\\Delta t} is the solution given by a numerical solver approximating the integral xk​Δ​t+∫k​Δ​t(k+1)​Δ​t(f+ge)​(x~s)​dssubscript𝑥𝑘Δ𝑡superscriptsubscript𝑘Δ𝑡𝑘1Δ𝑡𝑓subscript𝑔𝑒subscript~𝑥𝑠differential-d𝑠{x\\_{k\\\\Delta t}+\\\\int\\_{k\\\\Delta t}^{(k+1)\\\\Delta t}\\\\!\\\\mathopen{}\\\\mathclose{{}\\\\left(f+g\\_{e}}\\\\right)\\\\!(\\\\tilde{x}\\_{s})\\\\mathrm{d}s} starting from xk​Δ​tsubscript𝑥𝑘Δ𝑡x\\_{k\\\\Delta t}.

We opt for more practical forms in the experiments. For the infinity norm, we chose to minimize the empirical norm of the output vectors on known data points, this choice is motivated in Sup. [C]Appendix C Optimizing Ω in practice ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\").

            "content": "##### Limitations\n\nOur framework is generic and could be used in many different contexts. On the theoretical side, the existence and uniqueness properties (Prop. [1]Proposition 1 (Existence and Uniqueness). ‣ 2.2 LEADS framework ‣ 2 Approach ‣ LEADS: Learning Dynamical Systems that Generalize Across Environments\")) rely on relatively mild conditions covering a large number of situations. The complexity analysis, on the other side, is only practically relevant for simple hypothesis spaces (here linear), and then serves for developing the intuition on more complex spaces (NNs here) where bounds are too loose to be informative.\nAnother limitation is that the theory and experiments consider deterministic systems only: the experimental validation is performed on simulated deterministic data. Note however that this is the case in the vast majority of the ML literature on ODE/PDE spatio-temporal modeling \\[ [30]), [20]), [19]), [37])\\].\nIn addition, modeling complex dynamics from real world data is a problem by itself.\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nWe introduce LEADS, a data-driven framework to learn dynamics from data collected from a set of distinct dynamical systems with commonalities. Experimentally validated with three families of equations, our framework can significantly improve the test performance in every environment w.r.t. classical training, especially when the number of available trajectories is limited. We further show that the dynamics extracted by LEADS can boost the learning in similar new environments, which gives us a flexible framework for generalization in novel environments. More generally, we believe that this method is a promising step towards addressing the generalization problem for learning dynamical systems and has the potential to be applied to a large variety of problems.",

        "abstract": "When modeling dynamical systems from real-world data samples, the\ndistribution of data often changes according to the environment in which they\nare captured, and the dynamics of the system itself vary from one environment\nto another. Generalizing across environments thus challenges the conventional\nframeworks. The classical settings suggest either considering data as i.i.d.\nand learning a single model to cover all situations or learning\nenvironment-specific models. Both are sub-optimal: the former disregards the\ndiscrepancies between environments leading to biased solutions, while the\nlatter does not exploit their potential commonalities and is prone to scarcity\nproblems. We propose LEADS, a novel framework that leverages the commonalities\nand discrepancies among known environments to improve model generalization.\nThis is achieved with a tailored training formulation aiming at capturing\ncommon dynamics within a shared model while additional terms capture\nenvironment-specific dynamics. We ground our approach in theory, exhibiting a\ndecrease in sample complexity with our approach and corroborate these results\nempirically, instantiating it for linear dynamics. Moreover, we concretize this\nframework for neural networks and evaluate it experimentally on representative\nfamilies of nonlinear dynamics. We show that this new setting can exploit\nknowledge extracted from environment-dependent data and improves generalization\nfor both known and novel environments.

            "content": "The challenge of fast adaptation in machine learning is to learn on previously unseen tasks fast and with little data.\nIn principle, this can be achieved by leveraging knowledge obtained in other, related tasks.\nHowever, the best way to do so remains an open question.\nWe are interested in the meta-learning approach to fast adaptation, i.e., learning how to learn on unseen problems/datasets within few shots.\n\nOne approach for fast adaptation is to use gradient-based methods: at test time, only one or a few gradient update steps are performed to solve the new task, using a task-specific loss function.\nModel agnostic meta learning (MAML) (Finn et al., [2017a])) is a general and powerful gradient-based meta-learning algorithm, which learns a model initialisation that allows fast adaptation at test time.\nGiven that MAML is model-agnostic, it can be used with any gradient-based learning algorithm, and a variety of methods build on it (a.o., Lee & Choi ( [2018])); Li et al. ( [2017])); Al-Shedivat et al. ( [2018])); Grant et al. ( [2018]))).\n\nMAML is trained with an interleaved training procedure, comprised of inner loop and outer loop updates that operate on a batch of related tasks at each iteration.\nIn the inner loop, MAML learns task-specific network parameters by performing one gradient step on a task-specific loss.\nThen, in the outer loop, the model parameters from before the inner loop update are updated to reduce the loss after the inner loop update on the individual tasks.\nHence, MAML learns a model initialisation that can generalise to a new task after only a few gradient updates at test time.\nOne drawback of MAML is meta-overfitting: since the entire network is updated on just a few data points at test time, it can easily overfit (Mishra et al., [2018])).\n\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative to MAML which is more interpretable and less prone to overfitting, without compromising performance.\nOur method, fast context adaptation via meta-learning (CAVIA) learns a single model that adapts to a new task via gradient descent by updating only a set of input parameters at test time, instead of the entire network.\nThese inputs, which we call context parametersϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi (see Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 3.3 Conditioning on Context Parameters ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\")), can be interpreted as a task embedding that modulates the behaviour of the model.\nWe confirm empirically that the learned context parameters indeed match the latent task structure.\nLike MAML, our method is model-agnostic, i.e., it can be applied to any model that is trained via gradient descent.\n\nCAVIA is trained with an interleaved training procedure similar to MAML: in the inner loop only the context parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi are updated, and in the outer loop the rest of the model parameters, θ𝜃\\\\theta, are updated (which requires backpropagating through the inner-loop update).\nThis allows CAVIA to explicitly optimise the task-independent parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta for good performance across tasks, while ensuring that the task-specific parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi can quickly adapt to new tasks at test time.\n\nThe separation of parameters into task-specific and task-independent parts has several advantages.\nFirst, the size of both components can be chosen appropriately for the task.\nThe network parameters θ𝜃\\\\theta can be made expressive enough without overfitting to a single task in the inner loop, which MAML is prone to.\nFurthermore, for many practical problems we have prior knowledge of which aspects vary across tasks and hence how much capacity ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi should have.\n\nSecond, CAVIA is significantly easier to parallelise compared to MAML: learning task-specific context parameters for a batch of tasks can be parallelised in the inner loop.\nOther benefits are that parameter copies are not necessary which saves memory writes; we do not need to manually access and perform operations on the network weights and biases to set up the computation graphs; and CAVIA can help distributed machine learning systems, where the same model is deployed to different machines and we wish to learn different contexts concurrently.\n\nCAVIA is conceptually related to embedding-based approaches for fast adaptation such as conditional neural processes (CNPs) (Garnelo et al., [2018])) and meta-learning with latent embedding optimisation (LEO) (Rusu et al., [2019])).\nThese share the benefit of learning a low-dimensional representation of the task, which has the potential to lead to greater interpretability compared to MAML.\nIn contrast to existing methods, CAVIA uses the same network to learn the embedding (during a backward pass) and make predictions (during a forward pass).\nTherefore CAVIA has fewer parameters to train, but must compute higher-order gradients during training.\n\nOur experiments show that CAVIA outperforms MAML and CNPs on regression problems, can outperform MAML on a challenging classification benchmark by scaling up the network without overfitting, and outperforms MAML in a reinforcement learning setting while adapting significantly fewer parameters.\nWe also show that CAVIA is robust to hyperparameters and demonstrate that the context parameters represent meaningful embeddings of tasks.\nOur experiments also highlight a weakness in current benchmarks in meta-learning, in that the amount of adaptation needed is small in some cases, confirming that task inference and multitask learning are enough to do well.",

task, a good model for that task can be learned with only a small number of gradient steps and data points.\nIn the inner loop, MAML computes new task-specific parameters θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\\\theta\\_{i} (starting from θ𝜃\\\\theta) via one gradient update111We outline is MAML for one gradient update step and the supervised learning setting, but it can be used with several gradient update steps and for

After the first adaptation step they modulate the rest of the network to solve the new task.\n\nOther conditioning methods can be used with CAVIA as well:\ne.g., for convolutional networks, we use feature-wise linear modulation FiLM (Perez et al., [2017])), which performs an affine transformation on the feature maps.\nGiven context parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi and a convolutional layer that outputs M𝑀M feature maps {hi}i=1Msuperscriptsubscriptsubscriptℎ𝑖𝑖1𝑀\\\\{h\\_{i}\\\\}\\_{i=1}^{M}, FiLM linearly transforms each feature map F​i​L​M​(hi)=γi​hi+β𝐹𝑖𝐿𝑀subscriptℎ𝑖subscript𝛾𝑖subscriptℎ𝑖𝛽FiLM(h\\_{i})=\\\\gamma\\_{i}h\\_{i}+\\\\beta, where γ,β∈ℝM𝛾𝛽superscriptℝ𝑀\\\\gamma,\\\\beta\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{M} are a function of the context parameters.\nWe use a fully connected layer \\[γ,β\\]=∑k=1Kθk,i(l,ϕ)​ϕ0,k+b𝛾𝛽superscriptsubscript𝑘1𝐾subscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑙italic-ϕ𝑘𝑖subscriptitalic-ϕ0𝑘𝑏\\[\\\\gamma,\\\\beta\\]=\\\\sum\\_{k=1}^{K}\\\\theta^{(l,\\\\phi)}\\_{k,i}\\\\phi\\_{0,k}+b with the identity function at the output.\n\n### 3.4 Context Parameter Initialisation\n\nWhen learning a new task, ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi have to be initialised to some value, ϕ0subscriptitalic-ϕ0\\\\phi\\_{0}.\nWe argue that, instead of meta-learning this initialisation as well, a fixed ϕ0subscriptitalic-ϕ0\\\\phi\\_{0} is sufficient: in ( [9]In 3.3 Conditioning on Context Parameters ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\")), if both θj,i(l,ϕ)subscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑙italic-ϕ𝑗𝑖\\\\theta^{(l,\\\\phi)}\\_{j,i} and ϕ0subscriptitalic-ϕ0\\\\phi\\_{0} are meta-learned, the learned initialisation of ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi can be subsumed into the bias parameter b𝑏b, and ϕ0subscriptitalic-ϕ0\\\\phi\\_{0} can be set to a fixed value.\nHence, the initialisation of the context parameters does not have to be meta-learned and parameter copies are not required during training.\nIn our implementation we set the initial context parameter to a vector filled with zeros, ϕ0=𝟎=\\[0,…,0\\]⊤subscriptitalic-ϕ00superscript0…0top\\\\phi\\_{0}=\\\\mathbf{0}=\\[0,\\\\dotsc,0\\]^{\\\\top}.\n\nFurthermore, not updating the context parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi in the outer loop allows for a more flexible and expressive gradient in the inner loop.\nConsequently, CAVIA is more robust to the inner loop learning rate, α𝛼\\\\alpha in ( [5]In 3.1 Supervised Learning ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\")).\nBefore an inner loop update, the part of the model associated with ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi does not affect the output (since they are inputs and initialised at 0).\nDuring the inner update, only ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi changes and can affect the output of the network at test time.\nEven if this update is large, the parameters θk,i(l,ϕ)subscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑙italic-ϕ𝑘𝑖\\\\theta^{(l,\\\\phi)}\\_{k,i} that connect ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi to the rest of the model (shown in blue in Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 3.3 Conditioning on Context Parameters ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\")), are automatically scaled during the outer loop.\nIn other words, θk,i(l,ϕ)subscriptsuperscript𝜃𝑙italic-ϕ𝑘𝑖\\\\theta^{(l,\\\\phi)}\\_{k,i} compensates in the outer loop for any excessively large inner loop update of ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi.\nHowever, doing large gradient updates in every outer loop update step as well would lead to divergence and numerical overflow.\nIn Section [5.1]Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\"), we show empirically that the decoupling of learning ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi and θ𝜃\\\\theta can indeed make CAVIA more robust to the initial learning rate compared to also learning the initialisation of the context parameters.\n\n|  | Number of Additional Input Parameters |\n| --- | --- |\n| Method | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 50 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAVIA | - | 0.84​(±0.06)0.84plus-or-minus0.060.84(\\\\pm 0.06) | 0.21​(±0.02)0.21plus-or-minus0.020.21(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.20​(±0.02)0.20plus-or-minus0.020.20(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.19​(±0.02)0.19plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.19}(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.19​(±0.02)0.19plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.19}(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.19​(±0.02)0.19plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.19}(\\\\pm 0.02) |\n| MAML | 0.33​(±0.02)0.33plus-or-minus0.020.33(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.29​(±0.02)0.29plus-or-minus0.020.29(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.24​(±0.02)0.24plus-or-minus0.020.24(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.24​(±0.02)0.24plus-or-minus0.020.24(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.23​(±0.02)0.23plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.23}(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.23​(±0.02)0.23plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.23}(\\\\pm 0.02) | 0.23​(±0.02)0.23plus-or-minus0.02\\\\mathbf{0.23}(\\\\pm 0.02) |\n\nTable 1: Results for the sine curve regression task.

            "content": "One general approach to meta-learning is to learn the algorithm or update function itself (Schmidhuber, [1987]); Bengio et al., [1992]); Andrychowicz et al., [2016]); Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])).\nAnother approach is gradient-based meta-learning, which learns a model initialisation such that at test time, a new task can be learned within a few gradient steps.\nExamples are MAML (Finn et al., [2017a])) and its probabilistic variants (Grant et al., [2018]); Yoon et al., [2018]); Finn et al., [2018])); REPTILE (Nichol & Schulman, [2018])), which does not require second order gradient computation; and Meta-SGD (Li et al., [2017])), which learns the per-parameter inner loop learning rate.\nThe main difference to our work is that CAVIA adapts only a few parameters at test time, and these parameters determine only input context.\n\nClosely related are MT-Nets (Lee & Choi, [2018])), which learn which parameters to update in MAML.\nMT-Nets learn: an M-Net which is a mask indicating which parameters to update in the inner loop, sampled (from a learned probability distribution) for each new task; and a T-net which learns a task-specific update direction and step size.\nCAVIA is a simpler, more interpretable alternative where the task-specific and shared parameters are disjoint sets.\n\nAdditional input biases to MAML were considered by Finn et al. ( [2017b])), who show that this improves performance on a robotic manipulation setting.\nBy contrast, we update only the context parameters in the inner loop, and initialise them to 00 before adaptation to a new task.\nRei ( [2015])) propose a similar approach in the context of neural language models, where a context vector represents the sentence that is currently being processed (see also the Appendix of Finn et al. ( [2017a]))).\nUnlike CAVIA, this approach updates context parameters in the outer loop, i.e., it learns the initialisation of ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi.\nThis coupling of the gradient updates leads to a less flexible meta-update and is not as robust to the inner loop learning rate like CAVIA, as we show empirically in [5.1]Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\").\n\nSilver et al. ( [2008])) proposed context features as a component of inductive transfer, using a predefined one-hot encoded task-specifying context as input to the network.\nThey show that this works better than learning a shared feature extractor and having separate heads for all tasks.\nIn this paper, we instead learn this contextual input from data of a new task.\nSuch context features can also be learned by a separate embedding network as in, e.g., Oreshkin et al. ( [2018])) and Garnelo et al. ( [2018])), who use the task’s training set to condition the prediction network.\nCAVIA instead learns the context parameters via backpropagation through the same network used to solve the task.\n\nSeveral methods learn to produce network weights from task-specific embeddings or labelled datapoints (Gordon et al., [2018]); Rusu et al., [2019])), which then operate on the task-specific inputs.\nBy contrast, we learn an embedding that modulates a fixed network, and is independent of the task-specific inputs during the forward pass.\nSpecific to few-shot image classification, metric-based approaches learn to relate (embeddings of) labelled images and new instances of the same classes (Snell et al., [2017]); Sung et al., [2018])).\nBy contrast, CAVIA can be used for regression and reinforcement problems as well.\nOther meta-learning methods are also motivated by the practical difficulties of learning in high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the relative ease of fast adaptation in lower dimensional space (e.g., Sæmundsson et al., [2018]); Zhou et al., [2018])).\n\nIn the context of reinforcement learning, Gupta et al. ( [2018])) condition the policy on a latent random variable trained similarly to CAVIA, together with the reparametrisation trick (although they do not explicitly interpret these parameters as task embeddings).\nThis latent variable is sampled once per episode, and thus allows for structured exploration.\nUnlike CAVIA, they adapt the entire network at test time, which can be prone to overfitting.",

            "content": "In this section, we empirically evaluate CAVIA on regression, classification, and RL tasks.\nWe show that:\n1) adapting a small number of input parameters (instead of the entire network) is sufficient to yield performance equivalent to or better than MAML,\n2) CAVIA is robust to the task-specific learning rate and scales well without overfitting, and\n3) an embedding of the task emerges in the context parameters solely via backpropagation.\nCode is available at [https://github.com/lmzintgraf/cavia].\n\n### 5.1 Regression\n\n#### 5.1.1 Sine Curves\n\nWe start with the regression problem of fitting sine curves from Finn et al. ( [2017a])).\nA task is defined by the amplitude and phase of the sine curve and generated by uniformly sampling the amplitude from \\[0.1,0.5\\]0.10.5\\[0.1,0.5\\] and the phase from \\[0,π\\]0𝜋\\[0,\\\\pi\\].\nFor training, ten labelled datapoints (uniformly sampled from x∈\\[−5,5\\]𝑥55x\\\\in\\[-5,5\\]) are given for each task for the inner loop update, and we optimise a mean-squared error (MSE) loss.\nWe use a neural network with two hidden layers and 404040 nodes each.\nThe number of context parameters varies between 222 and 505050.\nPer meta-update we use a batch of 252525 tasks.\nDuring testing we present the model with ten datapoints from 100010001000 newly sampled tasks and measure MSE over 100 test points.\n\nTo allow a fair comparison, we add additional input biases to MAML (the same number as context parameters that CAVIA uses), an extension that was also done by Finn et al. ( [2017b])).\nThese additional parameters are meta-learned together with the rest of the network.\n\nTable 1 shows that CAVIA outperforms MAML even when MAML gets the same number of additional parameters, despite the fact that CAVIA adapts only 222-555 parameters, instead of around 160016001600.\nCAVIA’s performance on the regression task correlates with how many variables are needed to encode the tasks.\nIn these experiments, two parameters vary between tasks, which is exactly the context parameter dimensionality at which CAVIA starts to perform well (the optimal encoding is three dimensional, as phase is periodic).\nThis suggests CAVIA indeed learns task descriptions in the context parameters via backpropagation at test time.\nFigure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 5.1.1 Sine Curves ‣ 5.1 Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") illustrates this by plotting the value of the learned inputs against the amplitude/phase of the task in the case of two context parameters.\nThe model learns a smooth embedding in which interpolation between tasks is possible.\n\nWe also test how well CAVIA can continue learning at test time, when more gradient steps are performed than during training.\nFigure [2(a)]In Figure 2 ‣ 3.4 Context Parameter Initialisation ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows that CAVIA outperforms MAML even after taking several gradient update steps and is more stable, as indicated by the monotonic learning curve.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Visualisation of what the two context parameters learn on a new task. Shown is the value they take after 555 gradient update steps on a new task. Each dot is one random task; its colour indicates the amplitude (left) or phase (right) of that task.\n\nAs described in Section [3.4]Context Parameter Initialisation ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\"), CAVIA can scale the gradients of the context parameters since they are inputs to the model and trained separately.\nFigure [2(b)]In Figure 2 ‣ 3.4 Context Parameter Initialisation ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows the performance of CAVIA, MAML, and CAVIA when also learning the initialisation of ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi (i.e., updating the context parameters in the outer loop), for a varying learning rate from 10−6superscript10610^{-6} to 101010.\nCAVIA is robust to changes in learning rate while MAML performs well only in a small range.\nFigure [2(c)]In Figure 2 ‣ 3.4 Context Parameter Initialisation ‣ 3 CAVIA ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") gives insight into how CAVIA does this: we plot the inner learning rate against the norm of the gradient of the context parameters at test time.\nThe weights are adjusted so that lower learning rates bring about larger context parameter gradients and vice-versa.\nMT-Nets (Lee & Choi, [2018])), which learn which subset of parameters to adapt on a new task, are also robust to the inner-loop learning rate, but in a smaller range than CAVIA.222We do not show the numbers they report since we outperform them significantly, likely due to a different experimental protocol.\nSimilarly, Li et al. ( [2017])) show that MAML can be improved by learning a parameter-specific learning rate, which, however, introduces a lot of additional parameters.\n\n#### 5.1.2 Image Completion\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Image completion results on CelebA.

( [2017a])), and when using a larger network (results obtained with the author’s open sourced code and unchanged hyperparameters except the number of filters).\nThese results show that CAVIA is able to scale to larger networks without overfitting, and outperforms MAML by doing so.\nWe also include other CNN-based methods with similar experimental protocol.\nNote however that we did not tune CAVIA to compete with these methods, but focus on the comparison to MAML in this experiment.\n\nTo evaluate CAVIA on a more challenging regression task, we consider image completion (Garnelo et al., [2018])).\nThe task is to predict pixel values from coordinates, i.e., learn a function f:\\[0,1\\]2→\\[0,1\\]3:𝑓→superscript012superscript013f:\\[0,1\\]^{2}\\\\rightarrow\\[0,1\\]^{3} (for RGB values) which maps 222D pixel coordinates x∈\\[0,1\\]2𝑥superscript012x\\\\in\\[0,1\\]^{2} to pixel intensities y∈\\[0,1\\]3𝑦superscript013y\\\\in\\[0,1\\]^{3}.\nAn individual picture is considered a single task, and we are given a few pixels as a training set 𝒟trainsuperscript𝒟train\\\\mathcal{D}^{\\\\text{train}} and use the entire image as the test set 𝒟testsuperscript𝒟test\\\\mathcal{D}^{\\\\text{test}} (including the training set).\nWe train CAVIA on the CelebA (Liu et al., [2015])) training set, perform model selection on the validation set, and evaluate on the test set.\n\nGarnelo et al. ( [2018])) use an MLP encoder with three hidden layers and 128128128 nodes each, a 128128128-dimensional embedding size, and a decoder with five hidden layers with 128128128 nodes each.\nTo allow a fair comparison, we therefore choose a context vector of size 128128128, and use an MLP with five hidden layers (128128128 nodes each) for the main network.\nWe chose an inner-learning rate of 1.01.01.0 without tuning.\nTo train MAML, we use the same five-layer MLP network including 128128128 additional input biases, and an inner-loop learning rate of 0.10.10.1 (other tested learning rates: 1.01.01.0, 0.010.010.01).\nBoth CAVIA and MAML were trained with five inner-loop gradient updates.\n\nTable [2]Table 2 ‣ 5.1.2 Image Completion ‣ 5.1 Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows the results in terms of pixel-wise MSE for different numbers of training pixels (k=10,100,1000𝑘101001000k=10,100,1000 shot), and for the case of randomly selected pixels and ordered pixels (i.e., selecting pixels starting from the top left of the image).\nCAVIA outperforms CNPs and MAML in most settings.\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 5.1.2 Image Completion ‣ 5.1 Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows an example image reconstruction produced by CAVIA (see Appendix [C.3]C.3 Additional CelebA Image Completion Results ‣ Appendix C Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") for more results).\n\nThese results show that it is possible to learn an embedding only via backpropagation and with far fewer parameters than when using a separate embedding network.\n\n### 5.2 Classification\n\n![Refer to caption](a)Direction\n\n![Refer to caption](b)Velocity\n\nFigure 5: Performance of CAVIA and MAML on the RL Cheetah experiments. Both agents were trained to perform one gradient update, but are evaluated for several update steps. Results are averaged over 404040 randomly selected tasks.\n\nTo evaluate how well CAVIA can scale to problems that require larger networks, we test it on the few-shot image classification benchmark Mini-Imagenet (Ravi & Larochelle, [2017])).\nIn N𝑁N-way K𝐾K-shot classification, a task is a random selection of N𝑁N classes, for each of which the model gets to see K𝐾K examples.\nFrom these it must learn to classify unseen images from the N𝑁N classes.\nThe Mini-Imagenet dataset consists of 64 training classes, 12 validation classes, and 24 test classes.\nDuring training, we generate a task by selecting N𝑁N classes at random from the 646464 classes and training the model on K𝐾K examples of each, i.e., a batch of N×K𝑁𝐾N\\\\times K images.\nThe meta-update is done on a set of unseen images of the same classes.\n\nOn this benchmark, MAML uses a network with four convolutional layers with 323232 filters each and one fully connected layer at the output (Finn et al., [2017a])).\nWe use the same network architecture, but between 323232 and 512512512 filters per layer.\nWe use 100100100 context parameters and add a FiLM layer that conditions on these after the third convolutional layer and whose parameters are meta-learned with the rest of the network, i.e., they are part of θ𝜃\\\\theta.\nAll our models were trained with two gradient steps in the inner loop and evaluated with two gradient steps.\nFollowing (Finn et al., [2017a])), we ran each experiment for 60,0006000060,000 meta-iterations and selected the model with the highest validation accuracy for evaluation on the test set.\n\nTable [3]Table 3 ‣ 5.1.2 Image Completion ‣ 5.1 Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows our results on Mini-Imagenet held-out test data for 555-way 111-shot and 555-shot classification.\nOur smallest model (323232 filters) underperforms MAML (within the confidence intervals), and our largest model (512512512 filters) clearly outperforms MAML.\nWe also include results for the first order approximation of our largest models, where the gradient with respect to θ𝜃\\\\theta is not backpropagated through the inner loop update of the context parameters ϕitalic-ϕ\\\\phi.\nAs expected, this results in a lower accuracy (a drop of 2%percent22\\\\%) , but we still outperform MAML.\n\nCAVIA benefits from increasing model expressiveness:\nsince we only adapt the context parameters in the inner loop per task, we can substantially increase the network size without overfitting during the inner loop update.\nWe tested scaling up MAML to a larger network size as well (see Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 5.1.2 Image Completion ‣ 5.1 Regression ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\")), but found that this hurt accuracy, which was also observed by Mishra et al. ( [2018])).\n\nNote that we focus on the comparison to MAML in these experiments, since our goal is to show that CAVIA can scale to larger networks without overfitting compared to MAML, and can be used out-of-the-box for classification problems as well.\nWe did not tune CAVIA in terms of network architecture or other hyperparameters, but only varied the number of filters at each convolutional layer.\nThe best performing method with similar architecture and experimental protocol is VERSA (Gordon et al., [2018])), which learns to produce weights of the classifier, instead of modulating the network.\nThe current state-of-the-art results in Mini-Imagenet is (to the best of our knowledge) the method LEO Rusu et al. ( [2019])) who use pre-trained feature representations from a deep residual network (He et al., [2016])) and a different experimental protocol.\nCAVIA can be used with such embeddings as well, and we expect an increase in performance.\n\nIn conclusion, CAVIA can achieve much higher accuracies than MAML by increasing the network size, without overfitting.\nOur results are obtained by adjusting only 100100100 parameters at test time (instead of >30,0000absent300000>30,0000 like MAML), which embed the five different classes of the current task.\n\n### 5.3 Reinforcement Learning\n\nTo demonstrate the versatility of CAVIA, we also apply it to two high dimensional reinforcement learning MuJoCo (Todorov et al., [2012])) tasks using the setup of Finn et al. ( [2017a])).\nIn the first experiment, a Cheetah robot must run in a particular, randomly chosen direction (forward/backward), and receives as reward its speed in that direction.\nIn the second experiment, the Cheetah robot must run at a particular velocity, chosen uniformly at random between 0.00.00.0 and 2.02.02.0.\nThe agent’s reward is the negative absolute value between its current and the target velocity.\nEach rollout has a length of 200200200, and we use 202020 rollouts per gradient step during training, and a meta-batchsize of 404040 tasks per outer update.\nAs in Finn et al. ( [2017a])), our agents are trained for one gradient update, using policy gradient with generalised advantage estimation (Schulman et al., [2015b])) in the inner loop and TRPO (Schulman et al., [2015a])) in the outer loop update.\nFollowing the protocol of Finn et al. ( [2017a])), both CAVIA and MAML were trained for up to 500 meta-iterations, and the models with the best average return during training were used for evaluation.\nFor these tasks, we use 505050 context parameters for CAVIA and an inner-loop learning rate of 101010.\nWe found that starting with a higher learning rate helps for RL problems, since the policy update in the outer loop has a stronger signal from the context parameters.\n\nFigure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 5.2 Classification ‣ 5 Experiments ‣ Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning\") shows the performance of the CAVIA and MAML agents at test time, after up to three gradient steps (averaged over 404040 randomly selected test tasks).\nBoth models keep learning for several updates, although they were only trained for one update step.\nCAVIA outperforms MAML on both domains after one gradient update step, while updating only 505050 parameters at test time per task compared to >10,000absent10000>10,000.\nFor the Cheetah Velocity experiment, MAML catches up after three gradient update steps.",

            "content": "CAVIA is a meta-learning approach that separates the model into task-specific context parameters and parameters that are shared across tasks.\nWe demonstrated experimentally that CAVIA is robust to the inner loop learning rate and yields task embeddings in the context parameters.\nCAVIA outperforms MAML on challenging regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems, while adapting fewer parameters at test time and being less prone to overfitting.\n\nWe are interested in extending our experimental evaluation to settings with multi-modal task distributions, as well as settings where more generalisation beyond task identification is necessary at test time.\nOne possible approach here is to combine CAVIA with MAML-style updates in the future: i.e., having two separate inner loops (producing ϕisubscriptitalic-ϕ𝑖\\\\phi\\_{i} and θisubscript𝜃𝑖\\\\theta\\_{i}), and one outer loop.\n\nWe are interested in extending CAVIA to more challenging RL problems and exploring its role in allowing for smart exploration in order to identify the task at hand, for example building on the work of Gupta et al. ( [2018])) who use probabilistic context variables, or Stadie et al. ( [2018])), who propose E-MAML for RL problems, an extension for MAML which accounts for the effect of the initial sampling distribution (policy) before the inner-loop update.",
