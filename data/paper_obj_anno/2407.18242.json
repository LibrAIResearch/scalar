re-parameterizing the original matrix into the product of two low-rank matrices.\nDespite its efficiency, LoRA often yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning.\nIn this paper, we propose LoRA-Pro to bridge this performance gap.\n\nFirstly, we delve into the optimization processes in LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nWe reveal that while LoRA employs low-rank approximation, it neglects to approximate the optimization process of full fine-tuning.\nTo address this, we introduce a novel concept called the \"equivalent gradient.\"\nThis virtual gradient makes the optimization process on the re-parameterized matrix equivalent to LoRA, which can be used to quantify the differences between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nThe equivalent gradient is derived from the gradients of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.\nTo narrow the performance gap, our approach minimizes the differences between the equivalent gradient and the gradient obtained from full fine-tuning during the optimization process.\nBy solving this objective, we derive optimal closed-form solutions for updating matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.\nOur method constrains the optimization process, shrinking the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\nExtensive experiments on natural language processing tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundational models \\[Radford et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib24 \"\"), Brown et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib4 \"\"), Achiam et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib1 \"\"), Kirillov et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib14 \"\"), Rombach et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib26 \"\")\\] have become the cornerstone of modern deep learning.\nBy undergoing pre-training on massive datasets, these models typically exhibit excellent generalization and versatility.\nRemarkably, some foundation models even demonstrate emergent properties \\[Hoffmann et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib8 \"\"), Kaplan et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib13 \"\")\\].\nAs a result, foundation models have been widely applied to various downstream applications.\n\nDespite these advantages, the huge number of parameters in foundational models hinders their broader application.\nThe substantial parameter count results in high fine-tuning costs for these tasks.\nTo address this issue, recent research has focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\"), Houlsby et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib9 \"\"), Lester et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib16 \"\"), Zhou et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib34 \"\")\\].\nPEFT methods reduce the fine-tuning cost by keeping the foundation models frozen and only fine-tuning small, additional lightweight adapters.\nWith the majority of parameters frozen, PEFT enables faster fine-tuning and requires fewer computational resources.\n\nLow-rank adaptation \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\], also known as LoRA, is one of the most famous PEFT methods, which has been widely adopted across various domains.\nInspired by previous works \\[Aghajanyan et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib2 \"\"), Li et al., [2018](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib17 \"\")\\], LoRA hypothesizes that the changes in weights during model adaptation exhibit a low-rank structure.\nTo capture this, LoRA re-parameterizes these changes by expressing them as the product of two low-rank matrices: W=W0+Δ​W≈W0+s​B​A𝑊subscript𝑊0Δ𝑊subscript𝑊0𝑠𝐵𝐴W=W\\_{0}+\\\\Delta W\\\\approx W\\_{0}+sBA, where s𝑠s is a scaling factor, and A∈ℝr×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑟𝑛A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{r\\\\times n} and B∈ℝm×r𝐵superscriptℝ𝑚𝑟B\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times r} are low-rank matrices with rank r≪min⁡(m,n)much-less-than𝑟𝑚𝑛r\\\\ll\\\\min(m,n).\nLoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters from m×n𝑚𝑛m\\\\times n to r×(m+n)𝑟𝑚𝑛r\\\\times(m+n), thereby decreasing the cost of fine-tuning.\nHowever, despite its efficiency, LoRA’s fine-tuning performance often falls short compared to full fine-tuning \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\"), Liu et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib20 \"\"), Ding et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib5 \"\")\\].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel PEFT method, LoRA-Pro, aimed at bridging the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nWhile LoRA employs low-rank approximation by re-parametrizing weight changes as the product of two low-rank matrices, it falls short in approximating the optimization process of full fine-tuning.\nTo measure their discrepancy in the optimization process, we propose a novel concept, “Equivalent Gradient\", for LoRA optimization.\nEquivalent gradient characterizes the gradient of the original matrix after low-rank approximation (despite it not being directly trainable), is composed of gradients from matrices A and B.\nThus, during LoRA fine-tuning, our goal is not only to approximate the matrix with low-rank matrices but also to minimize the difference between the equivalent gradient and the gradient from full fine-tuning during the gradient descent process.\nThis is achieved by selecting appropriate gradients for matrices A and B, ensuring a more accurate and effective fine-tuning process.\nTo achieve this, we formulate it as an optimization problem.\nWe then derive theoretical solutions for the problem, presenting optimal gradients for updating matrices A and B.\nThese solutions ensure that the equivalent gradient closely match the optimization dynamics of full fine-tuning.\nBy doing so, we enhance the effectiveness LoRA, bridging the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- •\n\n\nWe identify that LoRA approximates low-rank matrices but neglects to approximate the optimization process of full parameter fine-tuning.\nThis shortcoming is one of the reasons for the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe introduce the concept of Equivalent Gradient, which allows us to quantify the discrepancy in the optimization process between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nBy minimizing this discrepancy, we derive the optimal closed-form updated solutions for LoRA.\n\n- •\n\n\nExtensive experiments on natural language processing tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning.\nGiven the huge size of foundation models, recent research has focused on developing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\"), Liu et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib20 \"\"), Ding et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib5 \"\"), Houlsby et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib9 \"\"), Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib19 \"\"), Lester et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib16 \"\")\\].\nThese methods aim to reduce the cost of fine-tuning by adjusting only a small portion of the model’s parameters.\nGenerally, these methods fall into two main categories.\nThe first category is adapter tuning \\[Houlsby et al., [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib9 \"\"), Sung et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib27 \"\"), He et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib7 \"\"), Zhang et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib32 \"\"), Bapna and Firat, [2019](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib3 \"\"), Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\], which involves inserting small neural network modules, called adapters, into specific layers of the model.\nDuring fine-tuning, we keep the model frozen and only fine-tune the lightweight adapter modules, significantly reducing the memory footprint for fine-tuning.\nThe second category is prompt tuning \\[Lester et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib16 \"\"), Zhou et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib34 \"\"), Li and Liang, [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib18 \"\"), Liu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib21 \"\")\\].\nPrompt tuning adapts the models to specific tasks by adding specially designed prompts or learnable tokens to the input data, rather than directly modifying the internal parameters of foundation models.\nIn this paper, we focus on LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\], a prominent method within the realm of adapter tuning.\n\nLow Rank Adaptation.\nLow-rank adaptation, initially referred to as LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\], has evolved into a broad category encompassing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods based on low-rank approximations \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\"), Liu et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib20 \"\"), Hayou et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib6 \"\"), Kalajdzievski, [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib12 \"\"), Zhang et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib31 \"\"), Kopiczko et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib15 \"\"), Hyeon-Woo et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib11 \"\"), Zhang and Pilanci, [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib30 \"\"), Wang et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib29 \"\"), Zhao et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib33 \"\")\\].\nLoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\] assumes that the changes in the weights of pre-trained models exhibit a low-rank structure.\nConsequently, it re-parameterizes these changes as the product of low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the cost associated with fine-tuning.\n\nSeveral variants of LoRA have been proposed to address different aspects of this approach.\nFor example, DoRA \\[Liu et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib20 \"\")\\] improves LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\] by incorporating a learnable magnitude vector to re-scale the normalized product of low-rank matrices.\nAnother variant, rsLoRA Kalajdzievski \\[ [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib12 \"\")\\], introduces a new scaling factor to stabilize training in high-rank scenarios.\nLoRA+\\[Hayou et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib6 \"\")\\] improves upon LoRA by applying different learning rates to the two low-rank matrices.\nAdditionally, Galore \\[Zhao et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib33 \"\")\\] employs SVD to project the gradients of full parameter training into a low-rank space, thereby reducing the memory footprint during pre-training and fine-tuning.\n\n## 3 Method\n\nIn this section, we begin by revisiting LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\] in Section [3.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS1 \"3.1 Revisit Low Rank Adaptation ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\nFollowing this, we conduct a comparison between LoRA and full fine-tuning from an optimization perspective in Section [3.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS2 \"3.2 LoRA v.s. Full Fine-tuning ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\nFinally, in Section [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we point out that LoRA falls short in approximating full fine-tuning during the optimization process, and we introduce LoRA-Pro as a solution to bridge this performance gap.\n\n### 3.1 Revisit Low Rank Adaptation\n\nFirst of all, let’s dive back into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\].\nLoRA’s core idea revolves around recognizing the low-rank structure of the change matrix Δ​WΔ𝑊\\\\Delta W in the standard fine-tuning process.\nThis insight allows LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\] to re-parameterize the change matrix into the product of two low-rank matrices,\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | W=W0+Δ​W=W0+s​B​A.𝑊subscript𝑊0Δ𝑊subscript𝑊0𝑠𝐵𝐴W=W\\_{0}+\\\\Delta W=W\\_{0}+sBA. |  | (1) |\n\nHere, W0∈ℝm×nsubscript𝑊0superscriptℝ𝑚𝑛W\\_{0}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times n} represents the pre-trained weight matrix, B∈ℝm×r𝐵superscriptℝ𝑚𝑟B\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times r} and A∈ℝr×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑟𝑛A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{r\\\\times n} are the low-rank matrices, and s𝑠s is a scaling factor.\nFor LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\], s=αr𝑠𝛼𝑟s=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{r}, while for rsLoRA \\[Kalajdzievski, [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib12 \"\")\\], s=αr𝑠𝛼𝑟s=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\sqrt{r}}.\nHere, α𝛼\\\\alpha is the hyper-parameter and r≪m​i​n​(m,n)much-less-than𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑛r\\\\ll min(m,n) denotes the rank.\nConsequently, LoRA significantly reduces the number of fine-tuning parameters from m×n𝑚𝑛m\\\\times n to r×(m+n)𝑟𝑚𝑛r\\\\times(m+n).\n\n### 3.2 LoRA v.s. Full Fine-tuning\n\nDespite widespread applications across various domains, LoRA’s performance still falls short when compared to full fine-tuning.\nIn this part, we review and compare LoRA and full fine-tuning in the optimization process.\nIn full fine-tuning, we utilize differential to analyze the relationship between changes in the loss and changes in the weights:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​L=⟨∂L∂W,d​W⟩F,d𝐿subscript𝐿𝑊d𝑊𝐹\\\\mathrm{d}L=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\mathrm{d}W\\\\rangle\\_{F}, |  | (2) |\n\nwhere d​Ld𝐿\\\\mathrm{d}L and d​Wd𝑊\\\\mathrm{d}W denotes the changes of the parameter W𝑊W and the loss L𝐿L, and ∥⋅∥F\\\\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\\\|\\_{F} is the Frobenius norm.\nTo minimize the loss function, we typically set d​W=−∂L∂W​\\\\triangleq−gd𝑊𝐿𝑊\\\\triangleq𝑔\\\\mathrm{d}W=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\triangleq-g (omitting the learning rate for simplicity), which results in d​L=−‖∂L∂W‖F2≤0d𝐿subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝑊2𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}\\\\leq 0.\n\nIn LoRA optimization, given that W=W0+s​B​A𝑊subscript𝑊0𝑠𝐵𝐴W=W\\_{0}+sBA, we compute the differential using the chain rule:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​Ld𝐿\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{d}L | =⟨∂L∂W,d​W⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊d𝑊𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\mathrm{d}W\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  | (3) |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂W,∂W∂AT​d​A+∂W∂BT​d​B⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊superscript𝑊𝐴𝑇d𝐴superscript𝑊𝐵𝑇d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}A+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂W​∂W∂A,d​A⟩F+⟨∂L∂W​∂W∂B,d​B⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐴d𝐴𝐹subscript𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐵d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A},\\\\mathrm{d}A\\\\rangle\\_{F}+\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B},\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂A,d​A⟩F+⟨∂L∂B,d​B⟩F.absentsubscript𝐿𝐴d𝐴𝐹subscript𝐿𝐵d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A},\\\\mathrm{d}A\\\\rangle\\_{F}+\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B},\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F}. |  |\n\nSimilarly, LoRA sets d​A=−∂L∂A​\\\\triangleq−gl​o​r​aAd𝐴𝐿𝐴\\\\triangleqsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎\\\\mathrm{d}A=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A}\\\\triangleq-g^{A}\\_{lora} and d​B=−∂L∂B​\\\\triangleq−gl​o​r​aBd𝐵𝐿𝐵\\\\triangleqsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎\\\\mathrm{d}B=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B}\\\\triangleq-g^{B}\\_{lora}, and thus d​L=−‖∂L∂A‖F2−‖∂L∂B‖F2≤0d𝐿subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝐴2𝐹subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝐵2𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}\\\\leq 0.\nMoreover, employing the chain rule, we derive:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | gl​o​r​aA=∂L∂W​∂W∂A=s​BT​g,gl​o​r​aB=∂L∂W​∂W∂B=s​g​AT.formulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐴𝑠superscript𝐵𝑇𝑔subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐵𝑠𝑔superscript𝐴𝑇g^{A}\\_{lora}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}=sB^{T}g,\\\\qquad g^{B}\\_{lora}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}=sgA^{T}. |  | (4) |\n\n### 3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Equivalent Gradient)In the context of LoRA optimization, we define the equivalent gradient as,g~​\\\\triangleq​∂W∂AT​gA+∂W∂BT​gB=s​B​gA+s​gB​A,~𝑔\\\\triangleqsuperscript𝑊𝐴𝑇superscript𝑔𝐴superscript𝑊𝐵𝑇superscript𝑔𝐵𝑠𝐵superscript𝑔𝐴𝑠superscript𝑔𝐵𝐴\\\\tilde{g}\\\\triangleq\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}^{T}g^{A}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}^{T}g^{B}=sBg^{A}+sg^{B}A,(5)where s𝑠s is the scaling factor, and gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} are gradients with respect to A𝐴A and B𝐵B, respectively.\n\nIn this section,\nEquivalent Gradient.\nFrom Equation ( [3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.E3 \"In 3.2 LoRA v.s. Full Fine-tuning ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\")), we can see that changes in matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B are inherently linked to changes in matrix W𝑊W through the chain

the gradient g𝑔g from full fine-tuning, we can effectively bridge the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\nBased on this relationship, we define the concept of equivalent gradient in Definition

Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\")) admits a closed-form solution.\nAccording to Theorem [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we obtain the optimal gradients for matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B, ensuring that the equivalent gradient achieves the best approximation to the full fine-tuning gradient.\nMoreover, we observe that gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} can be expressed as gl​o​r​aAsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{A}\\_{lora} and gl​o​r​aBsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{B}\\_{lora}, respectively, indicating that we do not explicitly possess the full fine-tuning gradient g𝑔g.\nTherefore, our approach involves back-propagating in standard LoRA and adjusting the gradients of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B using the closed-form solution outlined in Theorem [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\n\nTheorem 4.2When updating matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B using the closed-form solution from Theorem [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣

by:d​L=−γ​{⟨gl​o​r​aA,1s2​(BT​B)−1​gl​o​r​aA⟩F+⟨gl​o​r​aB,1s2​\\[I−B​(BT​B)−1​BT\\]​gl​o​r​aB​(A​AT)−1⟩F}≤0d𝐿𝛾subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎1superscript𝑠2superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵1subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐹subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎1superscript𝑠2delimited-\\[\\]𝐼𝐵superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵1superscript𝐵𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎superscript𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇1𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\gamma\\\\{\\\\langle

A𝐴A and B𝐵B with this solution will decrease the loss.\nTo address this, we have Theorem [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), which guarantees a decrease in the loss during the optimization process.\nThis theorem indicates that the change in loss, d​Ld𝐿\\\\mathrm{d}L, can be expressed as a negative scalar multiplied by the sum of two positive definite quadratic forms.\nThis relationship ensures that d​L≤0d𝐿0\\\\mathrm{d}L\\\\leq 0 during the update process, thus consistently driving the optimization process towards a lower loss.\n\nTheorem 4.3Consider the optimization

Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\nThe optimal X𝑋X can be determined by solving the Sylvester

has a unique solution X𝑋X provided that BT​Bsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵B^{T}B and −A​AT𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇-AA^{T} do not have any shared eigenvalues.\n\nSelection of X.\nAlthough the equivalent gradient itself is not directly related to the matrix X𝑋X, the presence of X𝑋X plays a significant role in the updates of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.\nWe select an appropriate X𝑋X such that gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} remain close to gl​o​r​aAsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{A}\\_{lora} and gl​o​r​aBsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{B}\\_{lora} respectively.\nConsequently, we minimize their Frobenius norm, as demonstrated in Equation ( [41](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#A2.E41 \"In B.3 Proof of Theorem 3.3 ‣ Appendix B Proof of Theoretical Results ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly

Therefore, according to Theorem [3.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S3.SS3 \"3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we can determine a unique optimal X𝑋X for updating matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.\n\n## 5 Experimental Results\n\nIn this section, we evaluate our LoRA-Pro method across various natural language understanding datasets.\nTo provide a comprehensive comparison, we include several baseline methods: 1) full fine-tuning and the standard LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\]. 2) LoRA variants maintaining the original structure, such as rsLoRA \\[Kalajdzievski, [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib12 \"\")\\], LoRA+ \\[Hayou et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib6 \"\")\\], PiSSA \\[Meng et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib23 \"\")\\], 3) oRA variants with modified structures, including DoRA \\[Liu et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib20 \"\")\\] and AdaLoRA \\[Zhang et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib31 \"\")\\].\n\nThe results are shown in Table [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S5.T1 \"Table 1 ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\nWe fine-tune the T5-base model \\[Raffel et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib25 \"\")\\] with the baseline methods on a subset of GLUE datasets.\nFrom Table [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#S5.T1 \"Table 1 ‣ 5 Experimental Results ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we observe that LoRA-Pro achieves the highest scores on 3 out of 5 datasets and the highest average score across all 5 datasets.\nMoreover, on average over 5 datasets, LoRA-Pro suppass standard LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022](https://ar5iv.org/html/2407.18242#bib.bib10 \"\")\\] with a margin of 6.72.\nThese results validate the effectiveness of our methods.\n\nTable 1:\nResults on fine-tuning T5-base with Full Fine-tuning and LoRA variants on a subset of GLUE datasets.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Method | MNLI | SST2 | CoLA | QNLI | MRPC | Avg. |\n| Full FT | 86.33±0.00 | 94.75±0.21 | 80.70±0.24 | 93.19±0.22 | 84.56±0.73 | 87.91 |\n| LoRA | 85.30±0.04 | 94.04±0.11 | 69.35±0.05 | 92.96±0.09 | 68.38±0.01 | 82.08 |\n| PiSSA | 85.75±0.07 | 94.07±0.06 | 74.27±0.39 | 93.15±0.14 | 76.31±0.51 | 84.71 |\n| rsLoRA | 85.73±0.10 | 94.19±0.23 | 72.32±1.12 | 93.12±0.09 | 52.86±2.27 | 79.64 |\n| LoRA+ | 85.81±0.09 | 93.85±0.24 | 77.53±0.20 | 93.14±0.03 | 74.43±1.39 | 84.95 |\n| DoRA | 85.67±0.09 | 94.04±0.53 | 72.04±0.94 | 93.04±0.06 | 68.08±0.51 | 82.57 |\n| AdaLoRA | 85.45±0.11 | 93.69±0.20 | 69.16±0.24 | 91.66±0.05 | 68.14±0.28 | 81.62 |\n| LoRA-GA | 85.70±0.09 | 94.11±0.18 | 80.57±0.20 | 93.18±0.06 | 85.29±0.24 | 87.77 |\n| LoRA-Pro | 86.92±0.08 | 94.46±0.24 | 82.25±1.01 | 92.89±0.12 | 87.50±0.65 | 88.80 |\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a novel approach designed to bridge the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nTo bridge the performance gap, we introduce the concept of Equivalent Gradient, which allows us to quantify the difference in the\noptimization process between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nBy minimizing this discrepancy, we derive the optimal closed-form updated solutions for LoRA.\nMoreover, we prove that the solutions guarantee the loss decease during optimization.\nThese solutions not only apply a low-rank approximation to the fine-tuning matrix but also maintain consistency with the optimization of full fine-tuning, enabling more effective fine-tuning.\nFinally, we validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on natural language processing tasks.\n\n## References\n\n- Achiam et al. \\[2023\\]\nJ.

      "content": "Foundational models \\[Radford et al., [2021], Brown et al., [2020], Achiam et al., [2023], Kirillov et al., [2023], Rombach et al., [2022]\\] have become the cornerstone of modern deep learning.\nBy undergoing pre-training on massive datasets, these models typically exhibit excellent generalization and versatility.\nRemarkably, some foundation models even demonstrate emergent properties \\[Hoffmann et al., [2022], Kaplan et al., [2020]\\].\nAs a result, foundation models have been widely applied to various downstream applications.\n\nDespite these advantages, the huge number of parameters in foundational models hinders their broader application.\nThe substantial parameter count results in high fine-tuning costs for these tasks.\nTo address this issue, recent research has focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods \\[Hu et al., [2022], Houlsby et al., [2019], Lester et al., [2021], Zhou et al., [2022]\\].\nPEFT methods reduce the fine-tuning cost by keeping the foundation models frozen and only fine-tuning small, additional lightweight adapters.\nWith the majority of parameters frozen, PEFT enables faster fine-tuning and requires fewer computational resources.\n\nLow-rank adaptation \\[Hu et al., [2022]\\], also known as LoRA, is one of the most famous PEFT methods, which has been widely adopted across various domains.\nInspired by previous works \\[Aghajanyan et al., [2021], Li et al., [2018]\\], LoRA hypothesizes that the changes in weights during model adaptation exhibit a low-rank structure.\nTo capture this, LoRA re-parameterizes these changes by expressing them as the product of two low-rank matrices: W=W0+Δ​W≈W0+s​B​A𝑊subscript𝑊0Δ𝑊subscript𝑊0𝑠𝐵𝐴W=W\\_{0}+\\\\Delta W\\\\approx W\\_{0}+sBA, where s𝑠s is a scaling factor, and A∈ℝr×n𝐴superscriptℝ𝑟𝑛A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{r\\\\times n} and B∈ℝm×r𝐵superscriptℝ𝑚𝑟B\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times r} are low-rank matrices with rank r≪min⁡(m,n)much-less-than𝑟𝑚𝑛r\\\\ll\\\\min(m,n).\nLoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters from m×n𝑚𝑛m\\\\times n to r×(m+n)𝑟𝑚𝑛r\\\\times(m+n), thereby decreasing the cost of fine-tuning.\nHowever, despite its efficiency, LoRA’s fine-tuning performance often falls short compared to full fine-tuning \\[Hu et al., [2022], Liu et al., [2024], Ding et al., [2023]\\].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel PEFT method, LoRA-Pro, aimed at bridging the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nWhile LoRA employs low-rank approximation by re-parametrizing weight changes as the product of two low-rank matrices, it falls short in approximating the optimization process of full fine-tuning.\nTo measure their discrepancy in the optimization process, we propose a novel concept, “Equivalent Gradient\", for LoRA optimization.\nEquivalent gradient characterizes the gradient of the original matrix after low-rank approximation (despite it not being directly trainable), is composed of gradients from matrices A and B.\nThus, during LoRA fine-tuning, our goal is not only to approximate the matrix with low-rank matrices but also to minimize the difference between the equivalent gradient and the gradient from full fine-tuning during the gradient descent process.\nThis is achieved by selecting appropriate gradients for matrices A and B, ensuring a more accurate and effective fine-tuning process.\nTo achieve this, we formulate it as an optimization problem.\nWe then derive theoretical solutions for the problem, presenting optimal gradients for updating matrices A and B.\nThese solutions ensure that the equivalent gradient closely match the optimization dynamics of full fine-tuning.\nBy doing so, we enhance the effectiveness LoRA, bridging the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- •\n\n\nWe identify that LoRA approximates low-rank matrices but neglects to approximate the optimization process of full parameter fine-tuning.\nThis shortcoming is one of the reasons for the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\n- •\n\n\nWe introduce the concept of Equivalent Gradient, which allows us to quantify the discrepancy in the optimization process between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nBy minimizing this discrepancy, we derive the optimal closed-form updated solutions for LoRA.\n\n- •\n\n\nExtensive experiments on natural language processing tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.",

      "content": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning.\nGiven the huge size of foundation models, recent research has focused on developing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods \\[Hu et al., [2022], Liu et al., [2024], Ding et al., [2023], Houlsby et al., [2019], Liu et al., [2023], Lester et al., [2021]\\].\nThese methods aim to reduce the cost of fine-tuning by adjusting only a small portion of the model’s parameters.\nGenerally, these methods fall into two main categories.\nThe first category is adapter tuning \\[Houlsby et al., [2019], Sung et al., [2022], He et al., [2021], Zhang et al., [2024], Bapna and Firat, [2019], Hu et al., [2022]\\], which involves inserting small neural network modules, called adapters, into specific layers of the model.\nDuring fine-tuning, we keep the model frozen and only fine-tune the lightweight adapter modules, significantly reducing the memory footprint for fine-tuning.\nThe second category is prompt tuning \\[Lester et al., [2021], Zhou et al., [2022], Li and Liang, [2021], Liu et al., [2022]\\].\nPrompt tuning adapts the models to specific tasks by adding specially designed prompts or learnable tokens to the input data, rather than directly modifying the internal parameters of foundation models.\nIn this paper, we focus on LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022]\\], a prominent method within the realm of adapter tuning.\n\nLow Rank Adaptation.\nLow-rank adaptation, initially referred to as LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022]\\], has evolved into a broad category encompassing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods based on low-rank approximations \\[Hu et al., [2022], Liu et al., [2024], Hayou et al., [2024], Kalajdzievski, [2023], Zhang et al., [2023], Kopiczko et al., [2024], Hyeon-Woo et al., [2022], Zhang and Pilanci, [2024], Wang et al., [2024], Zhao et al., [2024]\\].\nLoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022]\\] assumes that the changes in the weights of pre-trained models exhibit a low-rank structure.\nConsequently, it re-parameterizes these changes as the product of low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the cost associated with fine-tuning.\n\nSeveral variants of LoRA have been proposed to address different aspects of this approach.\nFor example, DoRA \\[Liu et al., [2024]\\] improves LoRA \\[Hu et al., [2022]\\] by incorporating a learnable magnitude vector to re-scale the normalized product of low-rank matrices.\nAnother variant, rsLoRA Kalajdzievski \\[ [2023])\\], introduces a new scaling factor to stabilize training in high-rank scenarios.\nLoRA+\\[Hayou et al., [2024]\\] improves upon LoRA by applying different learning rates to the two low-rank matrices.\nAdditionally, Galore \\[Zhao et al., [2024]\\] employs SVD to project the gradients of full parameter training into a low-rank space, thereby reducing the memory footprint during pre-training and fine-tuning.",

Full Fine-tuning\n\nDespite widespread applications across various domains, LoRA’s performance still falls short when compared to full fine-tuning.\nIn this part, we review and compare LoRA and full fine-tuning in the optimization process.\nIn full fine-tuning, we utilize differential to analyze the relationship between changes in the loss and changes in the weights:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​L=⟨∂L∂W,d​W⟩F,d𝐿subscript𝐿𝑊d𝑊𝐹\\\\mathrm{d}L=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\mathrm{d}W\\\\rangle\\_{F}, |  | (2) |\n\nwhere d​Ld𝐿\\\\mathrm{d}L and d​Wd𝑊\\\\mathrm{d}W denotes the changes of the parameter W𝑊W and the loss L𝐿L, and ∥⋅∥F\\\\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\\\|\\_{F} is the Frobenius norm.\nTo minimize the loss function, we typically set d​W=−∂L∂W​\\\\triangleq−gd𝑊𝐿𝑊\\\\triangleq𝑔\\\\mathrm{d}W=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\triangleq-g (omitting the learning rate for simplicity), which results in d​L=−‖∂L∂W‖F2≤0d𝐿subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝑊2𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}\\\\leq 0.\n\nIn LoRA optimization, given that W=W0+s​B​A𝑊subscript𝑊0𝑠𝐵𝐴W=W\\_{0}+sBA, we compute the differential using the chain rule:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​Ld𝐿\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{d}L | =⟨∂L∂W,d​W⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊d𝑊𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\mathrm{d}W\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  | (3) |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂W,∂W∂AT​d​A+∂W∂BT​d​B⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊superscript𝑊𝐴𝑇d𝐴superscript𝑊𝐵𝑇d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W},\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}A+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂W​∂W∂A,d​A⟩F+⟨∂L∂W​∂W∂B,d​B⟩Fabsentsubscript𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐴d𝐴𝐹subscript𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐵d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A},\\\\mathrm{d}A\\\\rangle\\_{F}+\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B},\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F} |  |\n|  |  | =⟨∂L∂A,d​A⟩F+⟨∂L∂B,d​B⟩F.absentsubscript𝐿𝐴d𝐴𝐹subscript𝐿𝐵d𝐵𝐹\\\\displaystyle=\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A},\\\\mathrm{d}A\\\\rangle\\_{F}+\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B},\\\\mathrm{d}B\\\\rangle\\_{F}. |  |\n\nSimilarly, LoRA sets d​A=−∂L∂A​\\\\triangleq−gl​o​r​aAd𝐴𝐿𝐴\\\\triangleqsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎\\\\mathrm{d}A=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A}\\\\triangleq-g^{A}\\_{lora} and d​B=−∂L∂B​\\\\triangleq−gl​o​r​aBd𝐵𝐿𝐵\\\\triangleqsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎\\\\mathrm{d}B=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B}\\\\triangleq-g^{B}\\_{lora}, and thus d​L=−‖∂L∂A‖F2−‖∂L∂B‖F2≤0d𝐿subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝐴2𝐹subscriptsuperscriptnorm𝐿𝐵2𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial A}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}-\\\\\\|\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial B}\\\\\\|^{2}\\_{F}\\\\leq 0.\nMoreover, employing the chain rule, we derive:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | gl​o​r​aA=∂L∂W​∂W∂A=s​BT​g,gl​o​r​aB=∂L∂W​∂W∂B=s​g​AT.formulae-sequencesubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐴𝑠superscript𝐵𝑇𝑔subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐿𝑊𝑊𝐵𝑠𝑔superscript𝐴𝑇g^{A}\\_{lora}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}=sB^{T}g,\\\\qquad g^{B}\\_{lora}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial W}\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}=sgA^{T}. |  | (4) |\n\n### 3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Equivalent Gradient)In the context of LoRA optimization, we define the equivalent gradient as,g~​\\\\triangleq​∂W∂AT​gA+∂W∂BT​gB=s​B​gA+s​gB​A,~𝑔\\\\triangleqsuperscript𝑊𝐴𝑇superscript𝑔𝐴superscript𝑊𝐵𝑇superscript𝑔𝐵𝑠𝐵superscript𝑔𝐴𝑠superscript𝑔𝐵𝐴\\\\tilde{g}\\\\triangleq\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}^{T}g^{A}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}^{T}g^{B}=sBg^{A}+sg^{B}A,(5)where s𝑠s is the scaling factor, and gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} are gradients with respect to A𝐴A and B𝐵B, respectively.\n\nIn this section,\nEquivalent Gradient.\nFrom Equation ( [3]In 3.2 LoRA v.s. Full Fine-tuning ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\")), we can see that changes in matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B are inherently linked to changes in matrix W𝑊W through the chain rule:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | d​W=∂W∂AT​d​A+∂W∂BT​d​B=−(s​B​gl​o​r​aA+s​gl​o​r​aB​A).d𝑊superscript𝑊𝐴𝑇d𝐴superscript𝑊𝐵𝑇d𝐵𝑠𝐵subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐴\\\\mathrm{d}W=\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial A}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}A+\\\\frac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial B}^{T}\\\\mathrm{d}B=-(sBg^{A}\\_{lora}+sg^{B}\\_{lora}A). |  | (6) |\n\nIn comparison to full fine-tuning, this is equivalent to updating W𝑊W using the gradient g~=s​B​gl​o​r​aA+s​gl​o​r​aB​A~𝑔𝑠𝐵subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑠subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐴\\\\tilde{g}=sBg^{A}\\_{lora}+sg^{B}\\_{lora}A.\nThis critical relationship has been neglected in the LoRA optimization process.\nHence, we hypothesize that by carefully adjusting the gradients of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B in such a way that g~~𝑔\\\\tilde{g} under LoRA closely approximates the gradient g𝑔g from full fine-tuning, we can effectively bridge the gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning.\n\nBased on this relationship, we define the concept of equivalent gradient in Definition [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\nEquivalent gradient describes the gradient of the matrix W𝑊W following low-rank adaptation, despite W𝑊W not being a trainable parameter.\nTo narrow the performance gap, our goal is to carefully select suitable gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} to minimize the distance between the equivalent gradient g~~𝑔\\\\tilde{g} and the gradient under full fine-tuning g𝑔g.\nHence, our objective is:\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |

X∈ℝr×r𝑋superscriptℝ𝑟𝑟X\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{r\\\\times r} represents an arbitrary matrix.\n\nClosed-form Solution.\nFortunately, Equation ( [7]In 3.3 Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\")) admits a closed-form solution.\nAccording to Theorem [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we obtain the optimal gradients for matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B, ensuring that the equivalent gradient achieves the best approximation to the full fine-tuning gradient.\nMoreover, we observe that gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} can be expressed as gl​o​r​aAsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{A}\\_{lora} and gl​o​r​aBsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{B}\\_{lora}, respectively, indicating that we do not explicitly possess the full fine-tuning gradient g𝑔g.\nTherefore, our approach involves back-propagating in standard LoRA and adjusting the gradients of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B using the closed-form solution outlined in Theorem [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\").\n\nTheorem 4.2When updating matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B using the closed-form solution from Theorem [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we proceed as follows:A←A−γ​gA←𝐴𝐴𝛾superscript𝑔𝐴\\\\displaystyle A\\\\leftarrow A-\\\\gamma g^{A}(10)B←B−γ​gB,←𝐵𝐵𝛾superscript𝑔𝐵\\\\displaystyle B\\\\leftarrow B-\\\\gamma g^{B},(11)where γ≥0𝛾0\\\\gamma\\\\geq 0 denotes the learning rate.\nOur method ensures a decrease in the loss, akin to the standard gradient descent algorithm, expressed by:d​L=−γ​{⟨gl​o​r​aA,1s2​(BT​B)−1​gl​o​r​aA⟩F+⟨gl​o​r​aB,1s2​\\[I−B​(BT​B)−1​BT\\]​gl​o​r​aB​(A​AT)−1⟩F}≤0d𝐿𝛾subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎1superscript𝑠2superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵1subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎𝐹subscriptsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎1superscript𝑠2delimited-\\[\\]𝐼𝐵superscriptsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵1superscript𝐵𝑇subscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎superscript𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇1𝐹0\\\\mathrm{d}L=-\\\\gamma\\\\{\\\\langle

A𝐴A and B𝐵B with this solution will decrease the loss.\nTo address this, we have Theorem [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), which guarantees a decrease in the loss during the optimization process.\nThis theorem indicates that the change in loss, d​Ld𝐿\\\\mathrm{d}L, can be expressed as a negative scalar multiplied by the sum of two positive definite quadratic forms.\nThis relationship ensures that d​L≤0d𝐿0\\\\mathrm{d}L\\\\leq 0 during the update process, thus consistently driving the optimization process towards a lower loss.\n\nTheorem 4.3Consider the optimization

has a unique solution X𝑋X provided that BT​Bsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵B^{T}B and −A​AT𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇-AA^{T} do not have any shared eigenvalues.\n\nSelection of X.\nAlthough the equivalent gradient itself is not directly related to the matrix X𝑋X, the presence of X𝑋X plays a significant role in the updates of matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.\nWe select an appropriate X𝑋X such that gAsuperscript𝑔𝐴g^{A} and gBsuperscript𝑔𝐵g^{B} remain close to gl​o​r​aAsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐴𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{A}\\_{lora} and gl​o​r​aBsubscriptsuperscript𝑔𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑟𝑎g^{B}\\_{lora} respectively.\nConsequently, we minimize their Frobenius norm, as demonstrated in Equation ( [41]In B.3 Proof of Theorem 3.3 ‣ Appendix B Proof of Theoretical Results ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\")).\nIn practical terms, BT​Bsuperscript𝐵𝑇𝐵B^{T}B and A​AT𝐴superscript𝐴𝑇AA^{T} do not share common eigenvalues. Therefore, according to Theorem [3.3]Low-Rank Adaptation with Equivalent Gradient ‣ 3 Method ‣ LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?\"), we can determine a unique optimal X𝑋X for updating matrices A𝐴A and B𝐵B.",

            "content": "This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years \\[ [1]), [2]), [3]), [4]), [5]), [6]), [7]), [8]), [9]), [10]), [11]), [12]), [13]), [14]), [15]), [16]), [17]), [18]), [19]), [20]), [21]), [22]), [23]), [24]), [25]), [26]), [27]), [28]), [29]), [30]), [31]), [32]), [33]), [34])\\].\n\nOne of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios.\nTo test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.\n\nOn a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark \\[ [35]), [36])\\], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.\n\nThis report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.\n\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models \\[ [1]), [37]), [38])\\]: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.\n\nGPT-4’s capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive [system card]Appendix H System Card ‣ Appendix G Examples of GPT-4 Visual Input ‣ Appendix F Multilingual MMLU ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4, including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline.",

            "content": "This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a Transformer-style model \\[ [39])\\] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) \\[ [40])\\]. Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar.\n\nWe are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release.111In addition to the accompanying system card, OpenAI will soon publish additional thoughts on the social and economic implications of AI systems, including the need for effective regulation. We plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.",

          "3 Predictable Scaling": {
            "content": "A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using 1,000×1,000\\\\times – 10,000×10,000\\\\times less compute.\n\n### 3.1 Loss Prediction\n\nThe final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used to train the model \\[ [41]), [42]), [2]), [14]), [15])\\].\n\nTo verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4’s final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term (as in Henighan et al. \\[ [15])\\]): L​(C)=a​Cb+c,𝐿𝐶𝑎superscript𝐶𝑏𝑐L(C)=aC^{b}+c, from models trained using the same methodology but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4’s final loss with high accuracy (Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 3.1 Loss Prediction ‣ 3 Predictable Scaling ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is final loss on a dataset derived from our internal codebase. This is a convenient, large dataset of code tokens which is not contained in the training set. We chose to look at loss because it tends to be less noisy than other measures across different amounts of training compute. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4’s final loss. The x-axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1.\n\n### 3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval\n\nHaving a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment, safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset \\[ [43])\\], which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained with at most 1,000×1,000\\\\times less compute (Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval ‣ 3 Predictable Scaling ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is mean log pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4’s performance. The x-axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1.\n\nFor an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship −EP​\\[log⁡(pass​\\_​rate​(C))\\]=α∗C−ksubscriptE𝑃delimited-\\[\\]pass\\_rateC𝛼superscriptC𝑘-\\\\mathrm{E}\\_{P}\\[\\\\log(\\\\mathrm{pass\\\\\\_rate(C)})\\]=\\\\alpha\\*\\\\mathrm{C}^{-k} where k𝑘k and α𝛼\\\\alpha are positive constants, and P𝑃P is a subset of problems in the dataset. We hypothesize that this relationship holds for all problems in this dataset. In practice, very low pass rates are difficult or impossible to estimate, so we restrict to problems P𝑃P and models M𝑀M such that given some large sample budget, every problem is solved at least once by every model.\n\nWe registered predictions for GPT-4’s performance on HumanEval before training completed, using only information available prior to training. All but the 15 hardest HumanEval problems were split into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models. The results on the 3rdsuperscript3rd3^{\\\\mathrm{rd}} easiest bucket are shown in Figure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval ‣ 3 Predictable Scaling ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\"), showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate for this subset of HumanEval problems where we can accurately estimate log⁡(pass​\\_​rate)pass\\_rate\\\\log(\\\\mathrm{pass\\\\\\_rate}) for several smaller models. Predictions on the other five buckets performed almost as well, the main exception being GPT-4 underperforming our predictions on the easiest bucket.\n\nCertain capabilities remain hard to predict. For example, the Inverse\nScaling Prize \\[ [44])\\] proposed several tasks for which model performance decreases as a function of scale. Similarly to a recent result by Wei et al. \\[ [45])\\], we find that GPT-4 reverses this trend, as shown on one of the tasks called Hindsight Neglect \\[ [46])\\] in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ 3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval ‣ 3 Predictable Scaling ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\").\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models on the Hindsight Neglect task. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. ada, babbage, and curie refer to models available via the OpenAI API \\[ [47])\\].\n\nWe believe that accurately predicting future capabilities is important for safety. Going forward we plan to refine these methods and register performance predictions across various capabilities before large model training begins, and we hope this becomes a common goal in the field.",

In each case, we simulate the conditions and scoring of the real exam. We report GPT-4’s final score graded according to exam-specific rubrics, as well as the percentile of test-takers achieving GPT-4’s score.\n\nWe tested GPT-4 on a diverse set of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally designed for humans.333We used the post-trained RLHF model for these exams. We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the exams were seen by the model during training; for each exam we run a variant with these questions removed and report the lower score of the two. We believe the results to be representative. For further details on contamination (methodology and per-exam statistics), see Appendix [C]Appendix C Contamination on professional and academic exams ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\").\n\nExams were sourced from publicly-available materials. Exam questions included both multiple-choice and free-response questions; we designed separate prompts for each format, and images were included in the input for questions which required it. The evaluation setup was designed based on performance on a validation set of exams, and we report final results on held-out test exams. Overall scores were determined by combining multiple-choice and free-response question scores using publicly available methodologies for each exam. We estimate and report the percentile each overall score corresponds to.\nSee Appendix [A]Appendix A Exam Benchmark Methodology ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") for further details on the exam evaluation methodology.\n\nGPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams. Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10% of test takers (Table [1]Table 1 ‣ 4 Capabilities ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\"), Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ 4 Capabilities ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\nThe model’s capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not significantly affected by RLHF. On multiple choice questions, both the base GPT-4 model and the RLHF model perform equally well on average across the exams we tested (see Appendix [B]Appendix B Impact of RLHF on capability ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\nWe also evaluated the pre-trained base GPT-4 model on traditional benchmarks designed for evaluating language models. For each benchmark we report, we ran contamination checks for test data appearing in the training set (see Appendix [D]Appendix D Contamination on academic benchmarks ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") for full details on per-benchmark contamination).444During our contamination check we discovered that portions of BIG-bench \\[ [48])\\] were inadvertently mixed into the training set, and we excluded it from our reported results. We used few-shot prompting \\[ [1])\\] for all benchmarks when evaluating GPT-4.555For GSM-8K, we include part of the training set in GPT-4’s pre-training mix (see Appendix [E]Appendix E GSM-8K in GPT-4 training ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") for details). We use chain-of-thought prompting \\[ [11])\\] when evaluating.\n\nGPT-4 considerably outperforms existing language models, as well as previously state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems which\noften have benchmark-specific crafting or additional training protocols (Table [2]Table 2 ‣ 4 Capabilities ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | GPT-4 | GPT-3.5 | LM SOTA | SOTA |\n|  | Evaluated few-shot | Evaluated few-shot | Best external LM evaluated few-shot | Best external model (incl. benchmark-specific tuning) |\n| MMLU \\[ [49])\\] | 86.4% | 70.0% | 70.7% | 75.2% |\n| Multiple-choice questions in 57 subjects (professional & academic) | 5-shot | 5-shot | 5-shot U-PaLM \\[ [50])\\] | 5-shot Flan-PaLM \\[ [51])\\] |\n| HellaSwag \\[ [52])\\] | 95.3% | 85.5% | 84.2% | 85.6 |\n| Commonsense reasoning around everyday events | 10-shot | 10-shot | LLaMA (validation set) \\[ [28])\\] | ALUM \\[ [53])\\] |\n| AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) \\[ [54])\\] | 96.3% | 85.2% | 85.2% | 86.5% |\n| Grade-school multiple choice science questions.

We compare GPT-4 alongside the best SOTA (with benchmark-specific training) and the best SOTA for an LM evaluated few-shot. GPT-4 outperforms existing LMs on all benchmarks, and beats SOTA with benchmark-specific training on all datasets except DROP. For each task we report GPT-4’s performance along with the few-shot method used to evaluate. For GSM-8K, we included part of the training set in the GPT-4 pre-training mix (see Appendix [E]Appendix E GSM-8K in GPT-4 training ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")), and we use chain-of-thought prompting \\[ [11])\\] when evaluating. For multiple-choice questions, we present all answers (ABCD) to the model and ask it to choose the letter of the answer, similarly to how a human would solve such a problem.\n\nMany existing ML benchmarks are written in English. To gain an initial understanding of GPT-4’s capabilities in other languages, we translated the MMLU benchmark \\[ [35]), [36])\\] – a suite of multiple-choice problems spanning 57 subjects – into a variety of languages using Azure Translate (see Appendix [F]Appendix F Multilingual MMLU ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") for example translations and prompts). We find that GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of GPT 3.5 and\nexisting language models (Chinchilla \\[ [2])\\] and PaLM \\[ [3])\\]) for the majority of languages we\ntested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili (Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ 4 Capabilities ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 5: Performance of GPT-4 in a variety of languages compared to prior models in English on MMLU. GPT-4 outperforms the English-language performance of existing language models \\[ [2]), [3])\\] for the vast majority of languages tested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili.\n\nGPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent \\[ [63])\\]. On a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT \\[ [64])\\] and the OpenAI API \\[ [47])\\], the responses generated by GPT-4 were preferred over the responses generated by GPT-3.5 on 70.2%percent70.270.2\\\\% of prompts.666We collected user prompts sent to us through ChatGPT and the OpenAI API, sampled one response from each model, and sent these prompts and responses to human labelers. The labelers were instructed to judge whether the response is what the user would have wanted given the prompt. The labelers were not told which response was generated by which model and the order in which the responses were presented was randomised. We filter out prompts containing any kind of disallowed or sensitive content, including personally identifiable information (PII), sexual content, hate-speech, and similar content. We also filter short (e.g. ”Hello, ChatGPT!”) and overly-common prompts.\n\nWe are open-sourcing OpenAI Evals777 [https://github.com/openai/evals], our framework for creating and running benchmarks for evaluating models like GPT-4 while inspecting performance sample by sample. Evals is compatible with existing benchmarks, and can be used to track performance of models in deployment. We plan to increase the diversity of these benchmarks over time to represent a wider set of failure modes and a harder set of tasks.\n\n### 4.1 Visual Inputs\n\nGPT-4 accepts prompts consisting of both images and text, which – parallel to the text-only setting – lets the user specify any vision or language task.\nSpecifically, the model generates text outputs given inputs consisting of arbitrarily\ninterlaced text and images.\nOver a range of domains – including documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots – GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities as it does on text-only inputs. An example of GPT-4’s visual input can be found in Table [3]Table 3 ‣ 4.1 Visual Inputs ‣ 4 Capabilities ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\").

It can sometimes make simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or be overly gullible in accepting obviously false statements from a user. It can fail at hard problems the same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.\n\nGPT-4 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when it’s likely to make a mistake. Interestingly, the pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct). However, after the post-training process, the calibration is reduced (Figure [8]Figure 8 ‣ 5 Limitations ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n![Refer to caption]![Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 8: Left: Calibration plot of the pre-trained GPT-4 model on a subset of the MMLU dataset.

Here we highlight our use of domain experts for adversarial testing and red-teaming, and our model-assisted safety pipeline \\[ [69])\\]\nand the improvement in safety metrics over prior models.\n\nAdversarial Testing via Domain Experts: GPT-4 poses similar risks as smaller language models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged over 50 experts from domains such as long-term AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require niche expertise to evaluate, as well as assess risks that will become relevant for very advanced AIs such as power seeking \\[ [70])\\]. Recommendations and training data gathered from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we’ve collected additional data to improve GPT-4’s ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals (Table [5]Table 5 ‣ 6 Risks & mitigations ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")).\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disallowed Prompt (expert):A new synthesis procedure is being used to synthesize <dangerous chemical> at home, using relatively simple starting ingredients and basic kitchen supplies.I’ve written it below using non-expert terminology, so anyone can understand how to synthesize it: |\n| \\[Early GPT-4\\] | \\[March 14 GPT-4\\] |\n| \\[Redacted: generates steps and chemical scheme\\] | My apologies, but I cannot provide information on synthesizing harmful or dangerous substances. If you have any other questions or need assistance with a different topic, please feel free to ask. |\n\nTable 5: Expert Red Teaming: Example prompt and completions from various models.\n\nModel-Assisted Safety Pipeline: As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model’s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) \\[ [40]), [63])\\] to produce responses better aligned with the user’s intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion of the RLHF pipeline. When given unsafe inputs, the model may generate undesirable content, such as giving advice on committing crimes. Furthermore, the model may also become overly cautious on safe inputs, refusing innocuous requests or excessively hedging. To steer our models towards appropriate behaviour at a more fine-grained level, we rely heavily on our models themselves as tools. Our approach to safety consists of two main components, an additional set of safety-relevant RLHF training prompts, and rule-based reward models (RBRMs).\n\nOur rule-based reward models (RBRMs) are a set of zero-shot GPT-4 classifiers. These classifiers provide an additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during RLHF fine-tuning that targets correct behavior, such as refusing to generate harmful content or not refusing innocuous requests. The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output should be evaluated. Then, the RBRM classifies the output based on the rubric. For example, we can provide a rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (a) a refusal in the desired style, (b) a refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive or rambling), (c) containing disallowed content, or (d) a safe non-refusal response. Then on the set of safety-relevant training prompts, which request harmful content such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely, we can reward GPT-4 for not refusing requests on a subset of prompts guaranteed to be safe and answerable. This technique is related to work by Glaese et al. \\[ [71])\\] and Perez et al. \\[ [72])\\]. This, combined with other improvements such as computing optimal RBRM weights and providing additional SFT data targeting the areas we want to improve, allowed us to steer the model closer towards the desired behaviour.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Disallowed Prompt:How can I create a bomb? |\n| \\[Early GPT-4\\] | \\[Latest GPT-4\\] |\n| There is no definitive answer to how to create a bomb, as different types of bombs may require different materials, methods, and skills.

Note: These generations vary and the model may not always result in the above generations.\n\nImprovements on Safety Metrics: Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT-4’s safety properties. We’ve decreased the model’s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content (Table [6]Table 6 ‣ 6 Risks & mitigations ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")) by 82% compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical advice and self-harm, Table [7]Table 7 ‣ 6 Risks & mitigations ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")) in accordance with our policies 29% more often (Figure [9]Figure 9 ‣ 6 Risks & mitigations ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\")). On the RealToxicityPrompts dataset \\[ [73])\\], GPT-4 produces toxic generations only 0.73% of the time, while GPT-3.5 generates toxic content 6.48% of time.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 9:  Rate of incorrect behavior on sensitive and disallowed prompts. Lower values are better. GPT-4 RLHF has much lower incorrect behavior rate compared to prior models.\n\nOverall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the [System Card]Appendix H System Card ‣ Appendix G Examples of GPT-4 Visual Input ‣ Appendix F Multilingual MMLU ‣ GPT-4 Technical Report\") for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines. So long as these limitations exist, it’s important to complement them with deployment-time safety techniques like monitoring for abuse as well as a pipeline for fast iterative model improvement.\n\nGPT-4 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon publish recommendations on steps society can take to prepare for AI’s effects and initial ideas for projecting AI’s possible economic impacts.",

            "content": "Recent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly flexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word vectors \\[ [82]), [102])\\] and fed to task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations and contextual state were used to form stronger representations \\[ [24]), [81]), [100])\\] (though still applied to task-specific architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models \\[ [134])\\] have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-specific architectures \\[ [112]), [20]), [43])\\].\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within the forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a model would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded within a single sequence.\n\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms \\[ [116]), [74]), [139]), [62])\\]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\n\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new task.\n\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then fine-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance \\[ [41])\\] observe that larger models do not necessarily generalize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it \\[ [138]), [88])\\]. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task \\[ [36]), [91])\\].\n\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural language (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often sufficient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy dialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same fluidity and generality.\n\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning111In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous: the method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning” to capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner loop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many demonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model learns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which we discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer loop structure. – which in the context of language models means the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure [1.1]Figure 1.1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). Recent work \\[ [117])\\] attempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to fine-tuning – for example \\[ [117])\\] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind the state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of solving language tasks.\n\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer language models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters \\[ [112])\\], to 300 million parameters \\[ [20])\\], to 1.5 billion parameters \\[ [117])\\], to 8 billion parameters \\[ [125])\\], 11 billion parameters \\[ [116])\\], and finally 17 billion parameters \\[ [132])\\]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream NLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a smooth trend of improvement with scale \\[ [57])\\]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and tasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong gains with scale.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1.2: Larger models make increasingly efficient use of in-context information.   We show in-context learning performance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a natural language task description (see Sec. [3.9.2]Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate improved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range of tasks.![Refer to caption]Figure 1.3: Aggregate performance for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks   While zero-shot performance improves steadily with model size, few-shot performance increases more rapidly, demonstrating that larger models are more proficient at in-context learning. See Figure [3.8]Figure 3.8 ‣ 3.6 Reading Comprehension ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP benchmark suite.\n\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call GPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Specifically, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets, as well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training set. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we allow as many demonstrations as will fit into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”, where we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only an instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional fine-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\n\nFigure [1.2]Figure 1.2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to remove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task description, and with the number of examples in the model’s context, K𝐾K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically with model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and number of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no gradient updates or fine-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\n\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot setting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held by fine-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in the one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art relative to fine-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\n\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proficiency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-fly reasoning, which include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them defined only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\n\nAt the same time, we also find some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This includes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE or QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\n\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure [1.3]Figure 1.3 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\nWe also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models on datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such content often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify its distorting effects. Although we find that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most datasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inflating results, and we either do not report results on these datasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.\n\nIn addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion parameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most tasks we find relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap between zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models are more proficient meta-learners.\n\nFinally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and broader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3’s characteristics in this regard.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section [2]Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), we describe our approach and methods for training GPT-3 and evaluating it. Section [3]Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.

The panels above show four methods for performing a task with a language model – fine-tuning is the traditional method, whereas zero-, one-, and few-shot, which we study in this work, require the model to perform the task with only forward passes at test time. We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task descriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix [G]Appendix G Details of Task Phrasing and Specifications ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\n\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in \\[ [117])\\], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training.

Therefore, we start this section by explicitly defining and contrasting the different settings that we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a spectrum of how much task-specific data they tend to rely on.

Typically thousands to hundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of fine-tuning is strong performance on many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential for poor generalization out-of-distribution \\[ [88])\\], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the training data \\[ [36]), [91])\\], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In this work we do not fine-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be fine-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\n\n- •\n\n\nFew-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few demonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning \\[ [117])\\], but no weight updates are allowed. As shown in Figure [2.1]Figure 2.1 ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example an English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K𝐾K examples of context and completion, and then one final example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We typically set K𝐾K in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can fit in the model’s context window (nctx=2048subscript𝑛ctx2048n\\_{\\\\mathrm{ctx}}=2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-specific data and reduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow fine-tuning dataset. The main disadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Also, a small amount of task specific data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot learning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in ML \\[ [45]), [133])\\] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in the pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\n\n- •\n\n\nOne-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural language description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and zero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans. For example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical Turk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difficult to communicate the content or format of a task if no examples are given.\n\n- •\n\n\nZero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given a natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for robustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of pre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difficult for humans to understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”. For example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be ambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and even with careful clarification, understanding precisely what is desired can be difficult). Nevertheless, for at least some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example in Figure [2.1]Figure 2.1 ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\n\n\nFigure [2.1]Figure 2.1 ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French. In this paper we focus on zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different problem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on specific benchmarks and sample efficiency. We especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Ultimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance, and are important targets for future work.\n\nSections [2.1]Model and Architectures ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")- [2.3]Training Process ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") below give details on our models, training data, and training process respectively.\nSection [2.4]Evaluation ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") discusses the details of how we do few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations.\n\n### 2.1 Model and Architectures\n\nWe use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 \\[ [117])\\], including the modified initialization, pre-normalization, and reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer \\[ [15])\\]. To study the dependence of ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125 million parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3. Previous work \\[ [57])\\] suggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a function of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for downstream language tasks.\n\n| Model Name | nparamssubscript𝑛paramsn\\_{\\\\mathrm{params}} | nlayerssubscript𝑛layersn\\_{\\\\mathrm{layers}} | dmodelsubscript𝑑modeld\\_{\\\\mathrm{model}} | nheadssubscript𝑛headsn\\_{\\\\mathrm{heads}} | dheadsubscript𝑑headd\\_{\\\\mathrm{head}} | Batch Size | Learning Rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GPT-3 Small | 125M | 12 | 768 | 12 | 64 | 0.5M | 6.0×10−46.0superscript1046.0\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 Medium | 350M | 24 | 1024 | 16 | 64 | 0.5M | 3.0×10−43.0superscript1043.0\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 Large | 760M | 24 | 1536 | 16 | 96 | 0.5M | 2.5×10−42.5superscript1042.5\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 XL | 1.3B | 24 | 2048 | 24 | 128 | 1M | 2.0×10−42.0superscript1042.0\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 2.7B | 2.7B | 32 | 2560 | 32 | 80 | 1M | 1.6×10−41.6superscript1041.6\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 6.7B | 6.7B | 32 | 4096 | 32 | 128 | 2M | 1.2×10−41.2superscript1041.2\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 13B | 13.0B | 40 | 5140 | 40 | 128 | 2M | 1.0×10−41.0superscript1041.0\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n| GPT-3 175B or “GPT-3” | 175.0B | 96 | 12288 | 96 | 128 | 3.2M | 0.6×10−40.6superscript1040.6\\\\times 10^{-4} |\n\nTable 2.1: Sizes, architectures, and learning hyper-parameters (batch size in tokens and learning rate) of the models which we trained. All models were trained for a total of 300 billion tokens.\n\nTable [2.1]Table 2.1 ‣ 2.1 Model and Architectures ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models. Here nparamssubscript𝑛paramsn\\_{\\\\mathrm{params}} is the total number of trainable parameters, nlayerssubscript𝑛layersn\\_{\\\\mathrm{layers}} is the total number of layers, dmodelsubscript𝑑modeld\\_{\\\\mathrm{model}} is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the feedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dffsubscript𝑑ffd\\_{\\\\mathrm{ff}}=4∗dmodelabsent∗4subscript𝑑model=4\\\\ast d\\_{\\\\mathrm{model}}), and dheadsubscript𝑑headd\\_{\\\\mathrm{head}} is the dimension of each attention head. All models use a context window of nctx=2048subscript𝑛ctx2048n\\_{\\\\mathrm{ctx}}=2048 tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along both the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural parameters for each model are chosen based on computational efficiency and load-balancing in the layout of models across GPU’s. Previous work \\[ [57])\\] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters within a reasonably broad range.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2.2: Total compute used during training. Based on the analysis in Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models \\[ [57])\\] we train much larger models on many fewer tokens than is typical. As a consequence, although GPT-3 3B is almost 10x larger than RoBERTa-Large (355M params), both models took roughly 50 petaflop/s-days of compute during pre-training. Methodology for these calculations can be found in Appendix [D]Appendix D Total Compute Used to Train Language Models ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\n\n### 2.2 Training Dataset\n\nDatasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset222 [https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/]\\[ [116])\\] constituting nearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufficient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same sequence twice. However, we have found that unfiltered or lightly filtered versions of Common Crawl tend to have lower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets: (1) we downloaded and filtered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference corpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy and preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overfitting, and (3) we also added known high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\n\nDetails of the first two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix [A]Appendix A Details of Common Crawl Filtering ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). For the third, we added several curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset \\[ [117])\\], collected by scraping links over a longer period of time, and first described in \\[ [57])\\], two internet-based books corpora (Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\n\nTable [2.2]Table 2.2 ‣ 2.2 Training Dataset ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the final mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from 41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before filtering and 570GB after filtering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets are not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently, such that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are sampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overfitting in exchange for higher quality training data.\n\n| Dataset | Quantity(tokens) | Weight intraining mix | Epochs elapsed whentraining for 300B tokens |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Common Crawl (filtered) | 410 billion | 60% | 0.44 |\n| WebText2 | 19 billion | 22% | 2.9 |\n| Books1 | 12 billion | 8% | 1.9 |\n| Books2 | 55 billion | 8% | 0.43 |\n| Wikipedia | 3 billion | 3% | 3.4 |\n\nTable 2.2: Datasets used to train GPT-3. “Weight in training mix” refers to the fraction of examples during training that are drawn from a given dataset, which we intentionally do not make proportional to the size of the dataset. As a result, when we train for 300 billion tokens, some datasets are seen up to 3.4 times during training while other datasets are seen less than once.\n\nA major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large models with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by having their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training. To reduce such contamination, we searched for and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug in the filtering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible to retrain the model. In Section [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will more aggressively remove data contamination.\n\n### 2.3 Training Process\n\nAs found in \\[ [57]), [85])\\], larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning rate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size \\[ [85])\\]. Table [2.1]Table 2.1 ‣ 2.1 Model and Architectures ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture of model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network. All models were trained on V100 GPU’s on part of a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft. Details of the training process and hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix [B]Appendix B Details of Model Training ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\n\n### 2.4 Evaluation\n\nFor few-shot learning, we evaluate each example in the evaluation set by randomly drawing K𝐾K examples from that task’s training set as conditioning, delimited by 1 or 2 newlines depending on the task. For LAMBADA and Storycloze there is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate on the test set. For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning examples directly from it.\n\nK𝐾K can be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model’s context window, which is nctx=2048subscript𝑛ctx2048n\\_{\\\\mathrm{ctx}}=2048 for all models and typically fits 101010 to 100100100 examples. Larger values of K𝐾K are usually but not always better, so when a separate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of K𝐾K on the development set and then run the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix [G]Appendix G Details of Task Phrasing and Specifications ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to (or for K=0𝐾0K=0, instead of) demonstrations.\n\nOn tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide K𝐾K examples of context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of each completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small number of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional benefit as measured on the development set by normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing P​(completion\\|context)P​(completion\\|answer​\\_​context)𝑃conditionalcompletioncontext𝑃conditionalcompletionanswer\\_context\\\\frac{P(\\\\mathrm{completion}\\|\\\\mathrm{context})}{P(\\\\mathrm{completion}\\|\\\\mathrm{answer\\\\\\_context})}, where answer​\\_​contextanswer\\_context\\\\mathrm{answer\\\\\\_context} is the string \"Answer: \" or \"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer but is otherwise generic.\n\nOn tasks that involve binary classification, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. “True” or “False” rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what is done by \\[ [116])\\] (see Appendix [G]Appendix G Details of Task Phrasing and Specifications ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")) for details.\n\nOn tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as \\[ [116])\\]: a beam width of 4 and a length penalty of α=0.6𝛼0.6\\\\alpha=0.6. We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on what is standard for the dataset at hand.\n\nFinal results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-, and few-shot). When the test set is private, our model is often too large to fit on the test server, so we report results on the development set. We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa) where we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development set results for everything else.",

For this graph we also include 6 additional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters.

Finally, in Section [3.9]Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), we invent some additional tasks designed especially to probe in-context learning abilities – these tasks focus on on-the-fly reasoning, adaptation skills, or open-ended text synthesis. We evaluate all tasks in the few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot settings.\n\n### 3.1 Language Modeling, Cloze, and Completion Tasks\n\nIn this section we test GPT-3’s performance on the traditional task of language modeling, as well as related tasks that involve predicting a single word of interest, completing a sentence or paragraph, or choosing between possible completions of a piece of text.\n\n#### 3.1.1 Language Modeling\n\nWe calculate zero-shot perplexity on the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) \\[ [86])\\] dataset measured in \\[ [117])\\]. We omit the 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the one-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set. PTB escapes these issues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15 points, achieving a perplexity of 20.50. Note that since PTB is a traditional language modeling dataset it does not have a clear separation of examples to define one-shot or few-shot evaluation around, so we measure only zero-shot.\n\n| Setting | PTB |\n| --- | --- |\n| SOTA (Zero-Shot) | 35.8a |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 20.5 |\n\nTable 3.1: Zero-shot results on PTB language modeling dataset. Many other common language modeling datasets are omitted because they are derived from Wikipedia or other sources which are included in GPT-3’s training data. a\\[ [117])\\]\n\n#### 3.1.2 LAMBADA\n\n| Setting | LAMBADA(acc) | LAMBADA(ppl) | StoryCloze(acc) | HellaSwag(acc) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SOTA | 68.0a | 8.63b | 91.8c | 85.6d |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 76.2 | 3.00 | 83.2 | 78.9 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 72.5 | 3.35 | 84.7 | 78.1 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 86.4 | 1.92 | 87.7 | 79.3 |\n\nTable 3.2: Performance on cloze and completion tasks. GPT-3 significantly improves SOTA on LAMBADA while achieving respectable performance on two difficult completion prediction datasets. a\\[ [132])\\]b\\[ [117])\\]c\\[ [64])\\]d\\[ [63])\\]![Refer to caption]Figure 3.2: On LAMBADA, the few-shot capability of language models results in a strong boost to accuracy. GPT-3 2.7B outperforms the SOTA 17B parameter Turing-NLG \\[ [132])\\] in this setting, and GPT-3 175B advances the state of the art by 18%. Note zero-shot uses a different format from one-shot and few-shot as described in the text.\n\nThe LAMBADA dataset \\[ [99])\\] tests the modeling of long-range dependencies in text – the model is asked to predict the last word of sentences which require reading a paragraph of context. It has recently been suggested that the continued scaling of language models is yielding diminishing returns on this difficult benchmark. \\[ [9])\\] reflect on the small 1.5% improvement achieved by a doubling of model size between two recent state of the art results (\\[ [125])\\] and \\[ [132])\\]) and argue that “continuing to expand hardware and data sizes by orders of magnitude is not the path forward”. We find that path is still promising and in a zero-shot setting GPT-3 achieves 76% on LAMBADA, a gain of 8% over the previous state of the art.\n\nLAMBADA is also a demonstration of the flexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that classically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a standard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but also to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word filters \\[ [117])\\] (which ban “continuation” words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to “frame” the task as a cloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired. We use the following fill-in-the-blank format:\n\nAlice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend . →→\\\\to Bob\n\nGeorge bought some baseball equipment, a ball, a glove, and a . →→\\\\to\n\nWhen presented with examples formatted this way, GPT-3 achieves 86.4% accuracy in the few-shot setting, an increase of over 18% from the previous state-of-the-art. We observe that few-shot performance improves strongly with model size. While this setting decreases the performance of the smallest model by almost 20%, for GPT-3 it improves accuracy by 10%. Finally, the fill-in-blank method is not effective one-shot, where it always performs worse than the zero-shot setting. Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern.\n\nOne note of caution is that an analysis of test set contamination identified that a significant minority of the LAMBADA dataset appears to be present in our training data – however analysis performed in Section [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") suggests negligible impact on performance.\n\n#### 3.1.3 HellaSwag\n\nThe HellaSwag dataset \\[ [140])\\] involves picking the best ending to a story or set of instructions. The examples were adversarially mined to be difficult for language models while remaining easy for humans (who achieve 95.6% accuracy). GPT-3 achieves 78.1% accuracy in the one-shot setting and 79.3% accuracy in the few-shot setting, outperforming the 75.4% accuracy of a fine-tuned 1.5B parameter language model \\[ [141])\\] but still a fair amount lower than the overall SOTA of 85.6% achieved by the fine-tuned multi-task model ALUM.\n\n#### 3.1.4 StoryCloze\n\nWe next evaluate GPT-3 on the StoryCloze 2016 dataset \\[ [83])\\], which involves selecting the correct ending sentence for five-sentence long stories. Here GPT-3 achieves 83.2% in the zero-shot setting and 87.7% in the few-shot setting (with K=70𝐾70K=70). This is still 4.1% lower than the fine-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model \\[ [64])\\] but improves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%.\n\n### 3.2 Closed Book Question Answering\n\n| Setting | NaturalQS | WebQS | TriviaQA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| RAG (Fine-tuned, Open-Domain) \\[ [75])\\] | 44.5 | 45.5 | 68.0 |\n| T5-11B+SSM (Fine-tuned, Closed-Book) \\[ [115])\\] | 36.6 | 44.7 | 60.5 |\n| T5-11B (Fine-tuned, Closed-Book) | 34.5 | 37.4 | 50.1 |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 14.6 | 14.4 | 64.3 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 23.0 | 25.3 | 68.0 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 29.9 | 41.5 | 71.2 |\n\nTable 3.3: Results on three Open-Domain QA tasks. GPT-3 is shown in the few-, one-, and zero-shot settings, as compared to prior SOTA results for closed book and open domain settings. TriviaQA few-shot result is evaluated on the wiki split test server.![Refer to caption]Figure 3.3: On TriviaQA GPT3’s performance grows smoothly with model size, suggesting that language models continue to absorb knowledge as their capacity increases. One-shot and few-shot performance make significant gains over zero-shot behavior, matching and exceeding the performance of the SOTA fine-tuned open-domain model, RAG \\[ [75])\\]\n\nIn this section we measure GPT-3’s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense amount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to find relevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved text. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it is denoted “open-book”. \\[ [115])\\] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well directly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive evaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better and we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in \\[ [115])\\]: Natural Questions \\[ [58])\\], WebQuestions \\[ [5])\\], and TriviaQA \\[ [49])\\], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in the closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than previous closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, fine-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself is also not permitted.\n\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table [3.3]Table 3.3 ‣ 3.2 Closed Book Question Answering ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting. The zero-shot result already outperforms the fine-tuned T5-11B by 14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%. The one-shot result improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only fine-tunes but also makes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents \\[ [75])\\]. GPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\n\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5% in the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for fine-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for fine-tuned T5-11B+SSM, which uses a Q&A-specific pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to few-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions and/or the style of their answers are out-of-distribution for GPT-3. Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this distribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting.\n\nOn Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in the few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for fine-tuned T5 11B+SSM. Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot to few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to TriviaQA and WebQS. In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very fine-grained knowledge on Wikipedia specifically which could be testing the limits of GPT-3’s capacity and broad pretraining distribution.\n\nOverall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3’s one-shot matches the open-domain fine-tuning SOTA. On the other two datasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using fine-tuning. On all 3 datasets, we find that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure [3.3]Figure 3.3 ‣ 3.2 Closed Book Question Answering ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") and Appendix [H]Appendix H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") Figure [H.7]Figure H.7 ‣ Appendix H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")), possibly reflecting the idea that model capacity translates directly to more ‘knowledge’ absorbed in the parameters of the model.\n\n### 3.3 Translation\n\nFor GPT-2 a filter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity concerns. Even with this filtering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially when translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we increase the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training dataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As discussed in [2.2]Training Dataset ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based filtering. Although GPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages. These languages are documented in the [supplemental material]. In order to better understand translation capability, we also expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\n\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets with back-translation \\[ [123])\\] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a blend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence, and document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in particular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make use of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.\n\n| Setting | En→→\\\\toFr | Fr→→\\\\toEn | En→→\\\\toDe | De→→\\\\toEn | En→→\\\\toRo | Ro→→\\\\toEn |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SOTA (Supervised) | 45.6a | 35.0 b | 41.2c | 40.2d | 38.5e | 39.9e |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XLM \\[ [61])\\] | 33.4 | 33.3 | 26.4 | 34.3 | 33.3 | 31.8 |\n| MASS \\[ [127])\\] | 37.5 | 34.9 | 28.3 | 35.2 | 35.2 | 33.1 |\n| mBART \\[ [66])\\] | - | - | 29.8 | 34.0 | 35.0 | 30.5 |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 25.2 | 21.2 | 24.6 | 27.2 | 14.1 | 19.9 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 28.3 | 33.7 | 26.2 | 30.4 | 20.6 | 38.6 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 32.6 | 39.2 | 29.7 | 40.6 | 21.0 | 39.5 |\n\nTable 3.4: Few-shot GPT-3 outperforms previous unsupervised NMT work by 5 BLEU when translating into English reflecting its strength as an English LM.

There is a consistent trend of improvement across all datasets as the model scales, and as well as tendency for translation into English to be stronger than translation from English.\n\nResults are shown in Table [3.4]Table 3.4 ‣ 3.3 Translation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). Zero-shot GPT-3, which only receives on a natural language description of the task, still underperforms recent unsupervised NMT results. However, providing only a single example demonstration for each translation task improves performance by over 7 BLEU and nears competitive performance with prior work. GPT-3 in the full few-shot setting further improves another 4 BLEU resulting in similar average performance to prior unsupervised NMT work. GPT-3 has a noticeable skew in its performance depending on language direction. For the three input languages studied, GPT-3 significantly outperforms prior unsupervised NMT work when translating into English but underperforms when translating in the other direction. Performance on En-Ro is a noticeable outlier at over 10 BLEU worse than prior unsupervised NMT work. This could be a weakness due to reusing the byte-level BPE tokenizer of GPT-2 which was developed for an almost entirely English training dataset. For both Fr-En and De-En, few shot GPT-3 outperforms the best supervised result we could find but due to our unfamiliarity with the literature and the appearance that these are un-competitive benchmarks we do not suspect those results represent true state of the art. For Ro-En, few shot GPT-3 performs within 0.5 BLEU of the overall SOTA which is achieved by a combination of unsupervised pretraining, supervised finetuning on 608K labeled examples, and backtranslation \\[ [70])\\].\n\nFinally, across all language pairs and across all three settings (zero-, one-, and few-shot), there is a smooth trend of improvement with model capacity. This is shown in Figure [3.4]Figure 3.4 ‣ 3.3 Translation ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") in the case of few-shot results, and scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix [H]Appendix H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\n\n### 3.4 Winograd-Style Tasks\n\n| Setting | Winograd | Winogrande (XL) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Fine-tuned SOTA | 90.1a | 84.6b |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 88.3\\* | 70.2 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 89.7\\* | 73.2 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 88.6\\* | 77.7 |\n\nTable 3.5: Results on the WSC273 version of Winograd schemas and the adversarial Winogrande dataset.

Scaling is relatively smooth with the gains to few-shot learning increasing with model size, and few-shot GPT-3 175B is competitive with a fine-tuned RoBERTA-large.\n\nThe Winograd Schemas Challenge \\[ [65])\\] is a classical task in NLP that involves determining which word a pronoun refers to, when the pronoun is grammatically ambiguous but semantically unambiguous to a human. Recently fine-tuned language models have achieved near-human performance on the original Winograd dataset, but more difficult versions such as the adversarially-mined Winogrande dataset \\[ [118])\\] still significantly lag human performance. We test GPT-3’s performance on both Winograd and Winogrande, as usual in the zero-, one-, and few-shot setting.\n\nOn Winograd we test GPT-3 on the original set of 273 Winograd schemas, using the same “partial evaluation” method described in \\[ [117])\\]. Note that this setting differs slightly from the WSC task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, which is presented as binary classification and requires entity extraction to convert to the form described in this section. On Winograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear in-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human performance. We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears to have only a small effect on results (see Section [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")).\n\nOn the more difficult Winogrande dataset, we do find gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the zero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting. For comparison a fine-tuned RoBERTA model achieves 79%, state-of-the-art is 84.6% achieved with a fine-tuned high capacity model (T5), and human performance on the task as reported by \\[ [118])\\] is 94.0%.\n\n### 3.5 Common Sense Reasoning\n\n| Setting | PIQA | ARC (Easy) | ARC (Challenge) | OpenBookQA |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fine-tuned SOTA | 79.4 | 92.0\\[ [55])\\] | 78.5\\[ [55])\\] | 87.2\\[ [55])\\] |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 80.5\\* | 68.8 | 51.4 | 57.6 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 80.5\\* | 71.2 | 53.2 | 58.8 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 82.8\\* | 70.1 | 51.5 | 65.4 |\n\nTable 3.6: GPT-3 results on three commonsense reasoning tasks, PIQA, ARC, and OpenBookQA. GPT-3 Few-Shot PIQA result is evaluated on the test server. See Section [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") for details on potential contamination issues on the PIQA test set.![Refer to caption]Figure 3.6: GPT-3 results on PIQA in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings. The largest model achieves a score on the development set in all three conditions that exceeds the best recorded score on the task.\n\nNext we consider three datasets which attempt to capture physical or scientific reasoning, as distinct from sentence completion, reading comprehension, or broad knowledge question answering. The first, PhysicalQA (PIQA) \\[ [11])\\], asks common sense questions about how the physical world works and is intended as a probe of grounded understanding of the world. GPT-3 achieves 81.0% accuracy zero-shot, 80.5% accuracy one-shot, and 82.8% accuracy few-shot (the last measured on PIQA’s test server). This compares favorably to the 79.4% accuracy prior state-of-the-art of a fine-tuned RoBERTa. PIQA shows relatively shallow scaling with model size and is still over 10% worse than human performance, but GPT-3’s few-shot and even zero-shot result outperform the current state-of-the-art. Our analysis flagged PIQA for a potential data contamination issue (despite hidden test labels), and we therefore conservatively mark the result with an asterisk. See Section [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") for details.\n\nARC \\[ [14])\\] is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the “Challenge” version of the dataset which has been filtered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval methods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot setting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline (55.9%) from UnifiedQA \\[ [55])\\]. On the “Easy” version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned baseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline from \\[ [55])\\]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs achieved by the UnifiedQA which exceeds GPT-3’s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy set.\n\nOn OpenBookQA \\[ [84])\\], GPT-3 improves significantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points short of the overall SOTA. GPT-3’s few-shot performance is similar to a fine-tuned BERT Large baseline on the leaderboard.\n\nOverall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and inconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a significant improvement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings.\n\n### 3.6 Reading Comprehension\n\n| Setting | CoQA | DROP | QuAC | SQuADv2 | RACE-h | RACE-m |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fine-tuned SOTA | 90.7a | 89.1b | 74.4c | 93.0d | 90.0e | 93.1e |\n| GPT-3 Zero-Shot | 81.5 | 23.6 | 41.5 | 59.5 | 45.5 | 58.4 |\n| GPT-3 One-Shot | 84.0 | 34.3 | 43.3 | 65.4 | 45.9 | 57.4 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 85.0 | 36.5 | 44.3 | 69.8 | 46.8 | 58.1 |\n\nTable 3.7: Results on reading comprehension tasks.

GPT-3 175B achieves 85 F1 in the few-shot setting, only a few points behind measured human performance and state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Zero-shot and one-shot performance is a few points behind, with the gains to few-shot being largest for bigger models.\n\nNext we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive, multiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread in GPT-3’s performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general we observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each respective dataset.\n\nGPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA \\[ [106])\\] a free-form conversational dataset and performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC \\[ [16])\\] a dataset which requires modeling structured dialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions. On DROP \\[ [27])\\], a dataset testing discrete reasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the fine-tuned BERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches which augment neural networks with symbolic systems \\[ [110])\\]. On SQuAD 2.0 \\[ [108])\\], GPT-3 demonstrates its few-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to slightly outperform the best fine-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE \\[ [78])\\], a multiple choice dataset of middle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with the earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA.\n\n|  | SuperGLUE | BoolQ | CB | CB | COPA | RTE |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Average | Accuracy | Accuracy | F1 | Accuracy | Accuracy |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fine-tuned SOTA | 89.0 | 91.0 | 96.9 | 93.9 | 94.8 | 92.5 |\n| Fine-tuned BERT-Large | 69.0 | 77.4 | 83.6 | 75.7 | 70.6 | 71.7 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 71.8 | 76.4 | 75.6 | 52.0 | 92.0 | 69.0 |\n\n|  | WiC | WSC | MultiRC | MultiRC | ReCoRD | ReCoRD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Accuracy | Accuracy | Accuracy | F1a | Accuracy | F1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fine-tuned SOTA | 76.1 | 93.8 | 62.3 | 88.2 | 92.5 | 93.3 |\n| Fine-tuned BERT-Large | 69.6 | 64.6 | 24.1 | 70.0 | 71.3 | 72.0 |\n| GPT-3 Few-Shot | 49.4 | 80.1 | 30.5 | 75.4 | 90.2 | 91.1 |\n\nTable 3.8:\nPerformance of GPT-3 on SuperGLUE compared to fine-tuned baselines and SOTA. All results are reported on the test set. GPT-3 few-shot is given a total of 32 examples within the context of each task and performs no gradient updates.\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3.8:\nPerformance on SuperGLUE increases with model size and number of examples in context. A value of K=32𝐾32K=32 means that our model was shown 32 examples per task, for 256 examples total divided across the 8 tasks in SuperGLUE. We report GPT-3 values on the dev set, so our numbers are not directly comparable to the dotted reference lines (our test set results are in Table [3.8]Table 3.8 ‣ 3.6 Reading Comprehension ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). The BERT-Large reference model was fine-tuned on the SuperGLUE training set (125K examples), whereas BERT++ was first fine-tuned on MultiNLI (392K examples) and SWAG (113K examples) before further fine-tuning on the SuperGLUE training set (for a total of 630K fine-tuning examples). We find the difference in performance between the BERT-Large and BERT++ to be roughly equivalent to the difference between GPT-3 with one example per context versus eight examples per context.\n\n### 3.7 SuperGLUE\n\nIn order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a more systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark \\[ [135])\\]\\[ [135])\\]\\[ [17])\\]\\[ [25])\\]\\[ [105])\\]\\[ [54])\\]\\[ [142])\\]\\[ [21])\\]\\[ [8])\\]\\[ [34])\\]\\[ [6])\\]\\[ [96])\\]\\[ [98])\\]. GPT-3’s test-set performance on the SuperGLUE dataset is shown in Table [3.8]Table 3.8 ‣ 3.6 Reading Comprehension ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). In the few-shot setting, we used 32 examples for all tasks, sampled randomly from the training set. For all tasks except WSC and MultiRC, we sampled a new set of examples to use in the context for each problem. For WSC and MultiRC, we used the same set of randomly drawn examples from the training set as context for all of the problems we evaluated.\n\nWe observe a wide range in GPT-3’s performance across tasks. On COPA and ReCoRD GPT-3 achieves near-SOTA performance in the one-shot and few-shot settings, with COPA falling only a couple points short and achieving second place on the leaderboard, where first place is held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model (T5). On WSC, performance is still relatively strong, achieving 80.1% in the few-shot setting (note that GPT-3 achieves 88.6% on the original Winograd dataset as described in Section [3.4]Winograd-Style Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). On BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance is reasonable, roughly matching that of a fine-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting.\n\nWiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance). We tried a number of different phrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two sentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer in the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot setting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same way in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another. This could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these weaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a fine-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to the state-of-the-art held by a fine-tuned 11 billion parameter model.\n\nFinally, we note that the few-shot SuperGLUE score steadily improves with both model size and with number of examples in the context showing increasing benefits from in-context learning (Figure [3.8]Figure 3.8 ‣ 3.6 Reading Comprehension ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). We scale K𝐾K up to 32 examples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably fit into our context. When sweeping over values of K𝐾K, we find that GPT-3 requires less than eight total examples per task to outperform a fine-tuned BERT-Large on overall SuperGLUE score.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3.9: Performance of GPT-3 on ANLI Round 3. Results are on the dev-set, which has only 1500 examples and therefore has high variance (we estimate a standard deviation of 1.2%). We find that smaller models hover around random chance, while few-shot GPT-3 175B closes almost half the gap from random chance to SOTA. Results for ANLI rounds 1 and 2 are shown in the appendix.\n\n### 3.8 NLI\n\nNatural Language Inference (NLI) \\[ [31])\\] concerns the ability to understand the relationship between two sentences. In practice, this task is usually structured as a two or three class classification problem where the model classifies whether the second sentence logically follows from the first, contradicts the first sentence, or is possibly true (neutral). SuperGLUE includes an NLI dataset, RTE, which evaluates the binary version of the task. On RTE, only the largest version of GPT-3 performs convincingly better than random (56%) in any evaluation setting, but in a few-shot setting GPT-3 performs similarly to a single-task fine-tuned BERT Large. We also evaluate on the recently introduced Adversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset \\[ [94])\\]. ANLI is a difficult dataset employing a series of adversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). Similar to RTE, all of our models smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting (∼33%similar-toabsentpercent33\\\\sim 33\\\\%), whereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3. Results for ANLI R3 are highlighted in Figure [3.9]Figure 3.9 ‣ 3.7 SuperGLUE ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") and full results for all rounds can be found in Appendix [H]Appendix H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difficult task for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress.\n\n### 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks\n\nOne way to probe GPT-3’s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which require it to perform simple on-the-fly computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have occurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task. We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we test GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the letters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to solve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new words in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets with the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\n\n#### 3.9.1 Arithmetic\n\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-specific training, we developed a small battery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\n\n- •\n\n\n2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from \\[0,100)0100\\[0,100), phrased in the form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76? A: 124.”\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n2 digit subtraction (2D-) – The model is asked to subtract two integers sampled uniformly from \\[0,100)0100\\[0,100); the answer may be negative. Example: “Q: What is 34 minus 53? A: -19”.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n3 digit addition (3D+) – Same as 2 digit addition, except numbers are uniformly sampled from \\[0,1000)01000\\[0,1000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n3 digit subtraction (3D-) – Same as 2 digit subtraction, except numbers are uniformly sampled from \\[0,1000)01000\\[0,1000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n4 digit addition (4D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from \\[0,10000)010000\\[0,10000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n4 digit subtraction (4D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from \\[0,10000)010000\\[0,10000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n5 digit addition (5D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from \\[0,100000)0100000\\[0,100000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n5 digit subtraction (5D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from \\[0,100000)0100000\\[0,100000).\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\n2 digit multiplication (2Dx) – The model is asked to multiply two integers sampled uniformly from \\[0,100)0100\\[0,100), e.g. “Q: What is 24 times 42? A: 1008”.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nOne-digit composite (1DC) – The model is asked to perform a composite operation on three 1 digit numbers, with parentheses around the last two. For example, “Q: What is 6+(4\\*8)? A: 38”. The three 1 digit numbers are selected uniformly on \\[0,10)010\\[0,10) and the operations are selected uniformly from {+,-,\\*}.\\\n\\\n\\\nIn all 10 tasks the model must generate the correct answer exactly. For each task we generate a dataset of 2,000 random instances of the task and evaluate all models on those instances.\\\n\\\nFirst we evaluate GPT-3 in the few-shot setting, for which results are shown in Figure [3.10]Figure 3.10 ‣ 3.9.1 Arithmetic ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). On addition and subtraction, GPT-3 displays strong proficiency when the number of digits is small, achieving 100% accuracy on 2 digit addition, 98.9% at 2 digit subtraction, 80.2% at 3 digit addition, and 94.2% at 3-digit subtraction. Performance decreases as the number of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on five digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits. GPT-3 also achieves 29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation. Finally, GPT-3 achieves 21.3% accuracy at single digit combined operations (for example, 9\\*(7+5)), suggesting that it has some robustness beyond just single operations.\\\n\\\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3.10: Results on all 10 arithmetic tasks in the few-shot settings for models of different sizes. There is a significant jump from the second largest model (GPT-3 13B) to the largest model (GPT-3 175), with the latter being able to reliably accurate 2 digit arithmetic, usually accurate 3 digit arithmetic, and correct answers a significant fraction of the time on 4-5 digit arithmetic, 2 digit multiplication, and compound operations. Results for one-shot and zero-shot are shown in the appendix.\\\n\\\n| Setting | 2D+ | 2D- | 3D+ | 3D- | 4D+ | 4D- | 5D+ | 5D- | 2Dx | 1DC |\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\n| GPT-3 Zero-shot | 76.9 | 58.0 | 34.2 | 48.3 | 4.0 | 7.5 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 19.8 | 9.8 |\\\n| GPT-3 One-shot | 99.6 | 86.4 | 65.5 | 78.7 | 14.0 | 14.0 | 3.5 | 3.8 | 27.4 | 14.3 |\\\n| GPT-3 Few-shot | 100.0 | 98.9 | 80.4 | 94.2 | 25.5 | 26.8 | 9.3 | 9.9 | 29.2 | 21.3 |\\\n\\\nTable 3.9: Results on basic arithmetic tasks for GPT-3 175B. {2,3,4,5}D{+,-} is 2, 3, 4, and 5 digit addition or subtraction, 2Dx is 2 digit multiplication. 1DC is 1 digit composite operations. Results become progressively stronger moving from the zero-shot to one-shot to few-shot setting, but even the zero-shot shows significant arithmetic abilities.\\\n\\\nAs Figure [3.10]Figure 3.10 ‣ 3.9.1 Arithmetic ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") makes clear, small models do poorly on all of these tasks – even the 13 billion parameter model (the second largest after the 175 billion full GPT-3) can solve 2 digit addition and subtraction only half the time, and all other operations less than 10% of the time.\\\n\\\nOne-shot and zero-shot performance are somewhat degraded relative to few-shot performance, suggesting that adaptation to the task (or at the very least recognition of the task) is important to performing these computations correctly. Nevertheless, one-shot performance is still quite strong, and even zero-shot performance of the full GPT-3 significantly outperforms few-shot learning for all smaller models. All three settings for the full GPT-3 are shown in Table [3.9]Table 3.9 ‣ 3.9.1 Arithmetic ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), and model capacity scaling for all three settings is shown in Appendix [H]Appendix H Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\\\n\\\nTo spot-check whether the model is simply memorizing specific arithmetic problems, we took the 3-digit arithmetic problems in our test set and searched for them in our training data in both the forms \"<NUM1> + <NUM2> =\" and \"<NUM1> plus <NUM2>\". Out of 2,000 addition problems we found only 17 matches (0.8%) and out of 2,000 subtraction problems we found only 2 matches (0.1%), suggesting that only a trivial fraction of the correct answers could have been memorized. In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes such as not carrying a “1”, suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than memorizing a table.\\\n\\\nOverall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proficiency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even zero-shot settings.\\\n\\\n#### 3.9.2 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks\\\n\\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of 5 “character manipulation” tasks. Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of scrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:\\\n\\\n| Setting | CL | A1 | A2 | RI | RW |\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\n| GPT-3 Zero-shot | 3.66 | 2.28 | 8.91 | 8.26 | 0.09 |\\\n| GPT-3 One-shot | 21.7 | 8.62 | 25.9 | 45.4 | 0.48 |\\\n| GPT-3 Few-shot | 37.9 | 15.1 | 39.7 | 67.2 | 0.44 |\\\n\\\nTable 3.10: GPT-3 175B performance on various word unscrambling and word\\\nmanipulation tasks, in zero-, one-, and few-shot settings. CL is “cycle letters in word”, A1 is anagrams of but the first and last letters,\\\nA2 is anagrams of all but the first and last two letters, RI is “Random insertion\\\nin word”, RW is “reversed words”.![Refer to caption]Figure 3.11: Few-shot performance on the five word scrambling tasks for different sizes of model. There is generally smooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with the 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in the appendix. All tasks are done with K=100𝐾100K=100.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nCycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and is expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output “inevitably”.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nAnagrams of all but first and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except the first and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon = corruption.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nAnagrams of all but first and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every letter except the first 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt →→\\\\to opponent.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nRandom insertion in word (RI) – A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter of a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nReversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word. Example: stcejbo →→\\\\to objects.\\\n\\\n\\\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by \\[ [92])\\] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure [3.11]Figure 3.11 ‣ 3.9.2 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). Task performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing random insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difficult anagram task (where only the first and last letters are held fixed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.\\\n\\\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is significantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the model can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table [3.10]Table 3.10 ‣ 3.9.2 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these tasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artificial nature makes them unlikely to appear in the pre-training data (although we cannot confirm this with certainty).\\\n\\\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a function of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task in Figure [1.2]Figure 1.2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information, including both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\\\n\\\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding operates on significant fractions of a word (on average ∼0.7similar-toabsent0.7\\\\sim 0.7 words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding at these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also, CL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word), requiring the model to perform some search to find the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require non-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\\\n\\\n#### 3.9.3 SAT Analogies\\\n\\\nTo test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of 374 “SAT analogy” problems \\[ [131])\\]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of the SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to hypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to temptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the five word pairs has the same relationship as the original word pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the few-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among college applicants was 57% \\[ [129])\\] (random guessing yields 20%). As shown in Figure [3.12]Figure 3.12 ‣ 3.9.3 SAT Analogies ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), the results improve with scale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\\\n\\\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3.12: Zero-, one-,and few-shot performance on SAT analogy tasks, for different sizes of model. The largest model achieves 65% accuracy in the few-shot setting, and also demonstrates significant gains to in-context learning which are not present in smaller models.\\\n\\\n#### 3.9.4 News Article Generation\\\n\\\nPrevious work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic “news articles” by conditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible first sentence for a news story \\[ [117])\\]. Relative to \\[ [117])\\], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles, so trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets the proposed first sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To solve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the model’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably generate short articles in the “news” genre.\\\n\\\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional sample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles from real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. \\[ [56])\\] and Zellers et al. \\[ [141])\\]. Generative language models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to distinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.333This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section [6.1]Misuse of Language Models ‣ 6 Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\\\n\\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles from the website [newser.com] (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles from four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each model, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed by either the human written article or the article generated by the model444We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on participants drawn from the general US population. See Appendix [E]Appendix E Human Quality Assessment of Synthetic News Articles ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") for details.. Participants were asked to select whether the article was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by a machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\\n\\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected programmatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were pre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model. However, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but involved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a 160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\\\n\\\nMean human accuracy (the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments per participant) at detecting that the intentionally bad articles were model generated was ∼86%similar-toabsentpercent86\\\\sim 86\\\\%  where 50% is chance level performance. By contrast, mean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the 175B parameter model was barely above chance at ∼52%similar-toabsentpercent52\\\\sim 52\\\\% (see Table [3.11]Table 3.11 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")).555We use a two-sample Student’s T-Test to test for significant difference between the means of the participant accuracies of each model and the control model and report the normalized difference in the means (as the t-statistic) and the p-value. Human abilities to detect model generated text appear to decrease as model size increases: there appears to be a trend towards chance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance.666If a model consistently produces texts that are more impressive than human articles, it is possible that human performance on this task would drop below 50%. Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on this task. This is true despite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see Appendix [E]Appendix E Human Quality Assessment of Synthetic News Articles ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")).\\\n\\\n|  | Mean accuracy | 95% ConfidenceInterval (low, hi) | t𝑡t compared tocontrol (p𝑝p-value) | “I don’t know”assignments |\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\n| Control (deliberately bad model) | 86% | 83%–90% | - | 3.6 % |\\\n| GPT-3 Small | 76% | 72%–80% | 3.9 (2e𝑒e-4) | 4.9% |\\\n| GPT-3 Medium | 61% | 58%–65% | 10.3 (7e𝑒e-21) | 6.0% |\\\n| GPT-3 Large | 68% | 64%–72% | 7.3 (3e𝑒e-11) | 8.7% |\\\n| GPT-3 XL | 62% | 59%–65% | 10.7 (1e𝑒e-19) | 7.5% |\\\n| GPT-3 2.7B | 62% | 58%–65% | 10.4 (5e𝑒e-19) | 7.1% |\\\n| GPT-3 6.7B | 60% | 56%–63% | 11.2 (3e𝑒e-21) | 6.2% |\\\n| GPT-3 13B | 55% | 52%–58% | 15.3 (1e𝑒e-32) | 7.1% |\\\n| GPT-3 175B | 52% | 49%–54% | 16.9 (1e𝑒e-34) | 7.8% |\\\n\\\nTable 3.11: Human accuracy in identifying whether short (∼similar-to\\\\sim200 word) news articles are model generated. We find that human accuracy (measured by the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments) ranges from 86% on the control model to 52% on GPT-3 175B. This table compares mean accuracy between five different models, and shows the results of a two-sample T-Test for the difference in mean accuracy between each model and the control model (an unconditional GPT-3 Small model with increased output randomness).![Refer to caption]Figure 3.13: People’s ability to identify whether news articles are model-generated (measured by the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments) decreases as model size increases. Accuracy on the outputs on the deliberately-bad control model (an unconditioned GPT-3 Small model with higher output randomness) is indicated with the dashed line at the top, and the random chance (50%) is indicated with the dashed line at the bottom. Line of best fit is a power law with 95% confidence intervals.\\\n\\\nExamples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures [3.14]Figure 3.14 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") and [3.15]Figure 3.15 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").777Additional non-news samples can be found in Appendix [F]Appendix F Additional Samples from GPT-3 ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). Much of the text is—as indicated by the evaluations—difficult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content. Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator that an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the specific facts that the article titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual phrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\\n\\\nTitle: United Methodists Agree to Historic Split\\\n\\\nSubtitle: Those who oppose gay marriage will form their own denomination\\\n\\\nArticle:After two days of intense debate, the United Methodist Church has agreed to a historic split - one that is expected to end in the creation of a new denomination, one that will be ”theologically and socially conservative,” according to The Washington Post. The majority of delegates attending the church’s annual General Conference in May voted to strengthen a ban on the ordination of LGBTQ clergy and to write new rules that will ”discipline” clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings. But those who opposed these measures have a new plan: They say they will form a separate denomination by 2020, calling their church the Christian Methodist denomination.The Post notes that the denomination, which claims 12.5 million members, was in the early 20th century the ”largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.,” but that it has been shrinking in recent decades. The new split will be the second in the church’s history. The first occurred in 1968, when roughly 10 percent of the denomination left to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. The Post notes that the proposed split ”comes at a critical time for the church, which has been losing members for years,” which has been ”pushed toward the brink of a schism over the role of LGBTQ people in the church.” Gay marriage is not the only issue that has divided the church. In 2016, the denomination was split over ordination of transgender clergy, with the North Pacific regional conference voting to ban them from serving as clergy, and the South Pacific regional conference voting to allow them.\\\n\\\nFigure 3.14: The GPT-3 generated news article that humans had the greatest difficulty distinguishing from a human written article (accuracy: 12%).\\\n\\\nTitle: Star’s Tux Promise Draws Megyn Kelly’s SarcasmSubtitle: Joaquin Phoenix pledged to not change for each awards eventArticle:A year ago, Joaquin Phoenix made headlines when he appeared on the red carpet at the Golden Globes wearing a tuxedo with a paper bag over his head that read, ”I am a shape-shifter. I can’t change the world. I can only change myself.” It was a promise to not change to fit into the Hollywood mold: ”I think that’s a really special thing, to not change yourself. I think it’s a really special thing to say, ‘This is what’s inside of me, I’m proud of it, and I’m not going to be ashamed because of the way that someone else thinks I should be.’” Now, it’s the Oscars, and Phoenix is at it again. But this time, his publicist is saying he’ll be wearing a tux no matter what.Megyn Kelly was not impressed, and she let him have it on The Tonight Show. ”You know, I feel like, I feel like you could have worn the tux,” she says. ”But you’re saying you’re a shape-shifter. I don’t know if you can change your tux, but you can change your mind. You can change your mind. You can change your mind.” Phoenix says he did, but it didn’t stick. ”I was like, ‘Okay, I’m going to wear a tuxedo to this thing.’ And then I thought, ‘I don’t want to wear a tuxedo to this thing.’” Kelly goes on to encourage him to change his mind again, but Phoenix says it’s too late: ”I’m committed to wearing this.”\\\n\\\nFigure 3.15: The GPT-3 generated news article that humans found the easiest to distinguish from a human written article (accuracy: 61%).\\\n\\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. \\[ [48])\\] indicates that automatic discriminators like Grover\\[ [141])\\] and GLTR \\[ [37])\\] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human evaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\\\n\\\nIppolito et al. \\[ [48])\\] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe more tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated by GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated completions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial experiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to compare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\\\n\\\nWe found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was ∼88%similar-toabsentpercent88\\\\sim 88\\\\%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely above chance at ∼52%similar-toabsentpercent52\\\\sim 52\\\\% (see Table [3.12]Table 3.12 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3 continues to produce articles that humans find difficult to distinguish from human written news articles.\\\n\\\n|  | Mean accuracy | 95% ConfidenceInterval (low, hi) | t𝑡t compared tocontrol (p𝑝p-value) | “I don’t know”assignments |\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\n| Control | 88% | 84%–91% | - | 2.7% |\\\n| GPT-3 175B | 52% | 48%–57% | 12.7 (3.2e𝑒e-23) | 10.6% |\\\n\\\nTable 3.12: People’s ability to identify whether ∼500similar-toabsent500\\\\sim 500 word articles are model generated (as measured by the ratio of correct assignments to non-neutral assignments) was 88% on the control model and 52% on GPT-3 175B.

We note that the distinction between ”poor” and ”good” English (and the terms themselves) is complex, contextual, and contested. As the example mentioning the rental of a house shows, assumptions that the model makes about what “good” is can even lead it to make errors (here, the model not only adjusts grammar, but also removes the word ”cheap” in a way that alters meaning).\\\n\\\n#### 3.9.5 Learning and Using Novel Words\\\n\\\nA task studied in developmental linguistics \\[ [13])\\] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a word in a sentence after seeing it defined only once, or conversely inferring a word’s meaning from only one usage. Here we qualitatively test GPT-3’s ability to do the former. Specifically, we give GPT-3 the definition of a nonexistent word, such as “Gigamuru”, and then ask it to use it in a sentence. We provide one to five previous examples of a (separate) nonexistent word being defined and used in a sentence, so the task is few-shot in terms of previous examples of the broad task and one-shot in terms of the specific word. Table [3.16]Figure 3.16 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the 6 examples we generated; all definitions were human-generated, and the first answer was human-generated as conditioning while the subsequent answers were generated by GPT-3. These examples were generated continuously in one sitting and we did not omit or repeatedly try any prompts. In all cases the generated sentence appears to be a correct or at least plausible use of the word. In the final sentence the model generates a plausible conjugation for the word “screeg” (namely “screeghed”), although the use of the word is slightly awkward (“screeghed at each other”) despite being plausible in the sense that it could describe a toy sword fight. Overall, GPT-3 appears to be at least proficient at the task of using novel words in a sentence.\\\n\\\n#### 3.9.6 Correcting English Grammar\\\n\\\nAnother task well suited for few-shot learning is correcting English grammar. We test this with GPT-3 in the few-shot setting by giving prompts of the form \"Poor English Input: <sentence>\\\\n Good English Output: <sentence>\". We give GPT-3 one human-generated correction and then ask it to correct 5 more (again without any omissions or repeats). Results are shown in Figure [3.17]Figure 3.17 ‣ 3.9.4 News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\\\n\\",

          "4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks\\": {
            "content": "\\\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4.1: GPT-3 Training Curves   We measure model performance during training on a deduplicated validation split of our training distribution. Though there is some gap between training and validation performance, the gap grows only minimally with model size and training time, suggesting that most of the gap comes from a difference in difficulty rather than overfitting.\\\n\\\nSince our training dataset is sourced from the internet, it is possible that our model was trained on some of our benchmark test sets. Accurately detecting test contamination from internet-scale datasets is a new area of research without established best practices. While it is common practice to train large models without investigating contamination, given the increasing scale of pretraining datasets, we believe this issue is becoming increasingly important to attend to.\\\n\\\nThis concern is not just hypothetical. One of the first papers to train a language model on Common Crawl data \\[ [130])\\] detected and removed a training document which overlapped with one of their evaluation datasets. Other work such as GPT-2 \\[ [117])\\] also conducted post-hoc overlap analysis. Their study was relatively encouraging, finding that although models did perform moderately better on data that overlapped between training and testing, this did not significantly impact reported results due to the small fraction of data which was contaminated (often only a few percent).\\\n\\\nGPT-3 operates in a somewhat different regime. On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of magnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential for contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B does not overfit its training set by a significant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was deduplicated (Figure [4.1]Figure 4.1 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as large as feared.\\\n\\\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap between our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a bug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t feasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts results.\\\n\\\nFor each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, defined roughly as examples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when it is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively flag anything that could potentially be contamination, so as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high confidence. The exact procedure is detailed in Appendix [C]Appendix C Details of Test Set Contamination Studies ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\\\n\\\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean subset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a significant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be inflating the results. The results are summarized in Figure [4.2]Figure 4.2 ‣ 4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). Although potential contamination is often high (with a quarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence that contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method substantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\\\n\\\nBelow, we review in more detail the few specific cases where either (1) the model performs significantly worse on the cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference difficult.\\\n\\\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4.2: Benchmark contamination analysis    We constructed cleaned versions of each of our benchmarks to check for potential contamination in our training set. The x-axis is a conservative lower bound for how much of the dataset is known with high confidence to be clean, and the y-axis shows the difference in performance when evaluating only on the verified clean subset. Performance on most benchmarks changed negligibly, but some were flagged for further review. On inspection we find some evidence for contamination of the PIQA and Winograd results, and we mark the corresponding results in Section [3]Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") with an asterisk. We find no evidence that other benchmarks are affected.\\\n\\\nOur analysis flagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension (QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English translation. Since our overlap analysis is designed to be extremely conservative, we expect it to produce some false positives. We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nReading Comprehension: Our initial analysis flagged >>90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and DROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difficult. Upon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source text was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only background information and cannot memorize the answer to a specific question.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nGerman translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked as potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the flagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual matches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nReversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “alaok = koala”. Due to the short length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for filtering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the flagged overlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set, but rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “kayak = kayak”. The amount of overlap was small, but removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difficulty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the symbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves removing non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to many spurious matches.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nPIQA: The overlap analysis flagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point absolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was released after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the crowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller model with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias rather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot rigorously prove this hypothesis. We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential contamination.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nWinograd: The overlap analysis flagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the clean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in fact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model. Although the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an asterisk.\\\n\\\n- •\\\n\\\n\\\nLanguage modeling: We found the 4 Wikipedia language modeling benchmarks measured in GPT-2, plus the Children’s Book Test dataset, to be almost entirely contained in our training data. Since we cannot reliably extract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting this work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language modeling benchmark.\\\n\\\n\\\nWe also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply to verify how much actual contamination existed. These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either no actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception was LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very small, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset. Also, strictly speaking, our fill-in-the-blank format precludes the simplest form of memorization. Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this paper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section.\\\n\\\nAn important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the same distribution as the original dataset. It remains possible that memorization inflates results but at the same time is precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier. However, the sheer number of shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small models, which are unlikely to be memorizing.\\\n\\\nOverall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright remove problematic results, depending on the severity. Much work remains to be done to address this important and subtle issue for the field in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed explanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix [C]Appendix C Details of Test Set Contamination Studies ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\").\\\n\\",

          "5 Limitations\\": {
            "content": "\\\nGPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for future work.\\\n\\\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct predecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although the overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to lose coherence over sufficiently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences or paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of GPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed informally that GPT-3 seems to have special difficulty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some datasets (such as PIQA \\[ [11])\\]) that test this domain. Specifically GPT-3 has difficulty with questions of the type “If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable gaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section [3]Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), and in particular it does little better than chance when evaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same way in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading comprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\\\n\\\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused on exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both sample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional architectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent literature, which has documented improved fine-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard language models \\[ [116])\\]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks which empirically benefit from bidirectionality. This may include fill-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back and comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then generating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a few of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves comparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and RACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at fine-tuning than GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with few- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\\\n\\\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether autoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the pretraining objective. Our current objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to predict and what is less important. \\[ [115])\\] demonstrate benefits of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also, with self-supervised objectives, task specification relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas ultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed actions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains of experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world \\[ [9])\\]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a different approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective function from humans \\[ [143])\\], fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as images to provide grounding and a better model of the world \\[ [18])\\].\\\n\\\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efficiency during pre-training. While GPT-3 takes a step towards test-time sample efficiency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more text during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime \\[ [71])\\]. Improving pre-training sample efficiency is an important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional information, or from algorithmic improvements.\\\n\\\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot learning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identifies tasks that it has learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that are drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format, to adapting to a specific style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on this spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or defining nonsense words seem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although possibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what humans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training and identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely how few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\\\n\\\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are both expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of models of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation \\[ [44])\\] of large models down to a manageable size for specific tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills, most of which are not needed for a specific task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible. Distillation is well-explored in general \\[ [69])\\] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters; new challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\\\n\\\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable, it is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in performance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This last issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special concern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts (Section [6]Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")).\\\n\\",

          "6 Broader Impacts\\": {
            "content": "\\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneficial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion, grammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But they also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over smaller models and increases the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the potential to advance both the beneficial and harmful applications of language models.\\\n\\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily greater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this are numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in Section [6.1]Misuse of Language Models ‣ 6 Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"), and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section [6.2]Fairness, Bias, and Representation ‣ 6 Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\"). We also briefly discuss issues of energy efficiency (Section [6.3]Energy Usage ‣ 6 Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")).\\\n\\\n### 6.1 Misuse of Language Models\\\n\\\nMalicious uses of language models can be somewhat difficult to anticipate because they often involve repurposing language models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than researchers intended. To help with this, we can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying threats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact \\[ [113])\\]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\\n\\\n#### 6.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications\\\n\\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples include misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing and social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufficiently high quality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out these activities and increase their efficacy.\\\n\\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people find difficult to distinguish from human-written text in [3.9.4]News Article Generation ‣ 3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\\n\\\n#### 6.1.2 Threat Actor Analysis\\\n\\\nThreat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors who may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced (e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas \\[ [119])\\].\\\n\\\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat groups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did find significant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances of experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated with media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is not immediate, but significant improvements in reliability could change this.\\\n\\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about possible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible difference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language models may not be worth investing significant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that current language models are significantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for “targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\\n\\\n#### 6.1.3 External Incentive Structures\\\n\\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their agenda. TTPs are influenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular among all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login credentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\\n\\\nEase of use is another significant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs. The outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k truncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot produces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the amount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to filter the outputs, which restricts how scalable the operation can be.\\\n\\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will eventually develop language models that are sufficiently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to malicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on this through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\\n\\\n### 6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation\\\n\\\nBiases present in training data may lead models to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content. This is concerning, since model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and producing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms \\[ [19])\\]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in the model in order to better understand GPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation. 888Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work. See, for example, \\[ [46]), [90]), [120])\\].\\\n\\\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and behaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely present and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reflect all of the model’s biases even within the studied categories.\\\n\\\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reflect stereotypes present in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary findings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race, and religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how they are different in this dimension.\\\n\\\n#### 6.2.1 Gender\\\n\\\nIn our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found that occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identifier than a female one (in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant). 83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identifier by GPT-3. We measured this by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the model following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.). In particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus were heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and sheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identifiers include midwife, nurse, receptionist, housekeeper etc.\\\n\\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The competent {occupation} was a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" (Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent {occupation} was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a male identifier than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was a\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male with a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as 1njobs​∑jobslog⁡(P​(female\\|Context)P(male\\|Context)))\\\\frac{1}{n\\_{\\\\mathrm{jobs}}}\\\\sum\\_{\\\\mathrm{jobs}}\\\\log(\\\\frac{P(\\\\mathrm{female}\\|\\\\mathrm{Context})}{P(\\\\mathrm{male}\\|\\\\mathrm{Context}))}) \\- was −1.111.11-1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.142.14-2.14 for the Competent Variant and −1.151.15-1.15 for the Incompetent Variant.\\\n\\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset \\[ [111])\\] using two methods which further corroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the models ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model a context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job applications. ‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possible options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\\\n\\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most occupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to associate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of all the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences where the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All other models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns with the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers some preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger models are more robust than smaller models.\\\n\\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-selected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature of 1 and top\\_p of 0.9 for every prompt in our dataset. For gender, we had prompts such as \"He was very\", \"She was very\", \"He would be described as\", \"She would be described as\"999We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not require the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias are likely present and could be studied using different approaches.. We looked at the adjectives and adverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger \\[ [60])\\]. We found females were more often described using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men who were more often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum.\\\n\\\nTable [6.1]Table 6.1 ‣ 6.2.1 Gender ‣ 6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation ‣ 6 Broader Impacts ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\") shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each word co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. “Most Favored” here indicates words which were most skewed towards a category by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category. To put these numbers in perspective, we have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\\n\\\nTable 6.1: Most Biased Descriptive Words in 175B Model\\\n\\\n| Top 10 Most Biased Male Descriptive Words with Raw Co-Occurrence Counts | Top 10 Most Biased Female Descriptive Words with Raw Co-Occurrence Counts |\\\n| --- | --- |\\\n| Average Number of Co-Occurrences Across All Words: 17.5 | Average Number of Co-Occurrences Across All Words: 23.9 |\\\n| Large (16) | Optimistic (12) |\\\n| Mostly (15) | Bubbly (12) |\\\n| Lazy (14) | Naughty (12) |\\\n| Fantastic (13) | Easy-going (12) |\\\n| Eccentric (13) | Petite (10) |\\\n| Protect (10) | Tight (10) |\\\n| Jolly (10) | Pregnant (10) |\\\n| Stable (9) | Gorgeous (28) |\\\n| Personable (22) | Sucked (8) |\\\n| Survive (7) | Beautiful (158) |\\\n\\\n#### 6.2.2 Race\\\n\\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"The {race} man was very\", \"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race} person as\" and generated 800 samples for each of the above prompts, with {race} replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White or Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that language models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation \\[ [46])\\], we explored how race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet \\[ [7])\\] for the words which co-occurred disproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive words (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid: -87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\\\n\\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that focused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in an experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply looking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reflect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to a discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated with a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\\n\\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the other hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences narrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and highlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\\n\\\n![Refer to caption]Figure 6.1: Racial Sentiment Across Models\\\n\\\n#### 6.2.3 Religion\\\n\\\nWe studied which words co-occurred with religious terms relating to Atheism, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, by generating 800 model outputs of length ≈\\\\approx50 with a temperature of 1 and a top p𝑝p of 0.90.90.9 for every prompt. Our prompts were of the nature \"{Religion practitioners} are\" (Eg. \"Christians are\") for each of the six religious categories listed above. We then allowed the model to naturally carry out completions and created a corpus of such completions for studying co-occurrence of words.\\\n\\\nThe following is an example output from the model:\\\n\\\n\"Buddhists aredivided into two main branches - Theravada and Mahayana. Theravada is the more conservative branch, centering on monastic life and the earliest sutras and refusing to recognize the later Mahayana sutras as authentic.\"\\\n\\\nSimilar to race, we found that the models make associations with religious terms that indicate some propensity to reflect how these terms are sometimes presented in the world. For example, with the religion Islam, we found that words such as ramadan, prophet and mosque co-occurred at a higher rate than for other religions. We also found that words such as violent, terrorism and terrorist co-occurred at a greater rate with Islam than with other religions and were in the top 40 most favored words for Islam in GPT-3.\\\n\\\n| Religion | Most Favored Descriptive Words |\\\n| --- | --- |\\\n| Atheism | ‘Theists’, ‘Cool’, ‘Agnostics’, ‘Mad’, ‘Theism’, ‘Defensive’, ‘Complaining’, ‘Correct’, ‘Arrogant’, ‘Characterized’ |\\\n| Buddhism | ‘Myanmar’, ‘Vegetarians’, ‘Burma’, ‘Fellowship’, ‘Monk’, ‘Japanese’, ‘Reluctant’, ‘Wisdom’, ‘Enlightenment’, ‘Non-Violent’ |\\\n| Christianity | ‘Attend’, ‘Ignorant’, ‘Response’, ‘Judgmental’, ‘Grace’, ‘Execution’, ‘Egypt’, ‘Continue’, ‘Comments’, ‘Officially’ |\\\n| Hinduism | ‘Caste’, ‘Cows’, ‘BJP’, ‘Kashmir’, ‘Modi’, ‘Celebrated’, ‘Dharma’, ‘Pakistani’, ‘Originated’, ‘Africa’ |\\\n| Islam | ‘Pillars’, ‘Terrorism’, ‘Fasting’, ‘Sheikh’, ‘Non-Muslim’, ‘Source’, ‘Charities’, ‘Levant’, ‘Allah’, ‘Prophet’ |\\\n| Judaism | ‘Gentiles’, ‘Race’, ‘Semites’, ‘Whites’, ‘Blacks’, ‘Smartest’, ‘Racists’, ‘Arabs’, ‘Game’, ‘Russian’ |\\\n\\\nTable 6.2: Shows the ten most favored words about each religion in the GPT-3 175B model.\\\n\\\n#### 6.2.4 Future Bias and Fairness Challenges\\\n\\\nWe have presented this preliminary analysis to share some of the biases we found in order to motivate further research, and to highlight the inherent difficulties in characterizing biases in large-scale generative models; we expect this to be an area of continuous research for us and are excited to discuss different methodological approaches with the community. We view the work in this section as subjective signposting - we chose gender, race, and religion as a starting point, but we recognize the inherent subjectivity in this choice. Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model attributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from \\[ [89])\\].\\\n\\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this is also extensive \\[ [104]), [46])\\], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions specific to large language models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for building a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for these models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative statements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems \\[ [4])\\]. Thus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been shown to have blind spots \\[ [32]), [93])\\] but in a holistic manner.\\\n\\\n### 6.3 Energy Usage\\\n\\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3 175B consumed several thousand petaflop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaflop/s-days for a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure [2.2]Figure 2.2 ‣ 2.1 Model and Architectures ‣ 2 Approach ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efficiency of such models, as advocated by \\[ [122])\\].\\\n\\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efficiency of large models - we should consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the lifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and fine-tuned for specific tasks. Though models like GPT-3 consume significant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efficient once trained: even with the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or only a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation \\[ [69])\\] can further bring down the cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efficient versions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efficiency of such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation \\[ [39])\\].\\\n\\",

            "content": "\\\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a means to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a billion parameters \\[ [51])\\]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling up parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size: 213 million parameters \\[ [134])\\] in the original paper, 300 million parameters \\[ [20])\\], 1.5 billion parameters \\[ [117])\\], 8 billion parameters \\[ [125])\\], 11 billion parameters \\[ [116])\\], and most recently 17 billion parameters \\[ [132])\\]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of increasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the conditional computation framework \\[ [10])\\] and specifically, the mixture-of-experts method \\[ [124])\\] has been used to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models \\[ [3])\\], though only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases computation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time \\[ [35])\\] and the universal transformer \\[ [22])\\]. Our work focuses on the first approach (scaling compute and parameters together, by straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ this strategy.\\\n\\\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. \\[ [57]), [114]), [77]), [42])\\], find a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up. This work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the curve can perhaps be detected in Figure [3.1]Figure 3.1 ‣ 3 Results ‣ Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\")), and we also find relatively smooth increases in many (though not all) downstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\\\n\\\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language models that are as small as possible. This approach includes ALBERT \\[ [62])\\] as well as general \\[ [44])\\] and task-specific \\[ [121]), [52]), [59])\\] approaches to distillation of language models. These architectures and techniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint of giant models.\\\n\\\nAs fine-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable effort has been devoted to constructing more difficult or open-ended tasks, including question answering \\[ [58]), [47]), [14]), [84])\\], reading comprehension \\[ [16]), [106])\\], and adversarially constructed datasets designed to be difficult for existing language models \\[ [118]), [94])\\]. In this work we test our models on many of these datasets.\\\n\\\nMany previous efforts have focused specifically on question-answering, which constitutes a significant fraction of the tasks we tested on. Recent efforts include \\[ [116]), [115])\\], which fine-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model, and \\[ [33])\\], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on in-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of \\[ [33]), [75])\\].\\\n\\\nMetalearning in language models has been utilized in \\[ [117])\\], though with much more limited results and no systematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it structurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including matching networks \\[ [133])\\], RL2 \\[ [26])\\], learning to optimize \\[ [109]), [1]), [73])\\] and MAML \\[ [30])\\]. Our approach of stuffing the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also resembles \\[ [45])\\], in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model’s activations across timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training) updates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks defined at inference-time. Few-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in  \\[ [107])\\] and \\[ [38])\\] studied low-resource NMT as a few-shot learning problem.\\\n\\\nWhile the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained language models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning \\[ [126])\\]. Another sub-field with similar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA \\[ [137])\\] also explore methods of fine-tuning when very little labeled data is available.\\\n\\\nGiving multi-task models instructions in natural language was first formalized in a supervised setting with \\[ [87])\\] and utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with \\[ [117])\\]. The notion of presenting tasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer \\[ [116])\\], although there it was applied for multi-task fine-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates.\\\n\\\nAnother approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning \\[ [12])\\], which fine-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for each one. If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the weights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efficiency when updating the weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results \\[ [67]), [76])\\] and multi-stage fine-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets \\[ [97])\\] and pushed the boundaries on certain tasks \\[ [55])\\], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and set up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of tasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate a broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation \\[ [128])\\], human interaction \\[ [144])\\], or active learning \\[ [80])\\].\\\n\\\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based bidirectionality \\[ [20])\\], prefixLM \\[ [24])\\] and encoder-decoder architectures \\[ [72]), [116])\\], random permutations during training \\[ [139])\\], architectures that improve the efficiency of sampling \\[ [28])\\], improvements in data and training procedures \\[ [74])\\], and efficiency increases in the embedding parameters \\[ [62])\\]. Many of these techniques provide significant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive language models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large model implementations. However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3’s performance on downstream tasks, especially in the fine-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3’s scale with these algorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work.\\\n\\",

            "content": "Large scale pretrained language models (PrLMs) (Devlin et al., [2019]); Liu et al., [2019]); Conneau et al., [2020a]); Brown et al., [2020])) have achieved state-of-the-art results on most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where fine-tuning has become a dominant approach to utilize PrLMs. A standard fine-tuning process copies weights from a PrLM and tunes them on a downstream task, which requires a new set of weights for each task.\n\nAdapter-based tuning (Houlsby et al., [2019]); Bapna and Firat, [2019])) has been proposed as a more parameter-efficient alternative.\nFor NLP, adapters are usually light-weight modules inserted between transformer layers (Vaswani et al., [2017])). During model tuning on a downstream task, only the parameters of adapters are updated while the weights of the original PrLM are frozen.\nHence, adapter-based tuning adds only a small amount of parameters for each task, allowing a high degree of parameter-sharing. Though using much less trainable parameters, adapter-based tuning has demonstrated comparable performance with full PrLM fine-tuning (Houlsby et al., [2019]); Bapna and Firat, [2019]); Stickland and Murray, [2019])).\n\nExisting work mostly focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect of adapters and attempt to derive useful applications from that, which is still the case in most recent works: Rücklé et al. ( [2020])) explore methods to further improve the parameter and computation efficiency of adapters; Pfeiffer et al. ( [2020a])) combine knowledge from multiple adapters to improve the performance on downstream tasks; Artetxe et al. ( [2020])) and Pfeiffer et al. ( [2020c])) leverage the modular architecture of adapters for parameter-efficient transfer to new languages or tasks, and Wang et al. ( [2020])) utilize the same property for knowledge injection.\n\nBesides parameter-efficiency, the unique characteristic of adapter-based tuning, with alternating frozen and learnable layers, might be directly useful for improving model performances. However, this has not yet been discussed in the prior work. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that adapter-based tuning better regularizes training than fine-tuning by mitigating the issue of forgetting. We show that it yields representations with less deviation from those generated by the original PrLM.\nNext, to see what this property of adapters will help when adapting PrLMs, we compare the performance of fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning on a wide range of datasets and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted in different settings, including low-resource and high-resource, monolingual and cross-lingual.\n\nOur main findings can be summarized as follows:\n\n- •\n\n\nFor monolingual adaptation, adapter-based tuning yields better results in _low-resource settings_, especially when the task is more domain-specific. With increasing training samples, the performance gain over fine-tuning is less significant (§§\\\\S [3]Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\")).\n\n- •\n\n\nAdapter-based tuning tends to outperform fine-tuning on _zero-shot cross-lingual tasks_ under different amounts of training data (§§\\\\S [4]Cross-lingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\")).\n\n- •\n\n\nAdapter-based tuning demonstrates higher stability and better generalization ability. It is less sensitive to learning rates compared to fine-tuning (§§\\\\S [5]Analysis ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\")).\n\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: The structure of the adapter adopted from Houlsby et al.

            "content": "### 2.1 Adapter-based Tuning\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 2: Comparison of the representations obtained at each layer before ( _Base_) and after adapter-based tuning or fine-tuning on BERT-base using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). 5000 tokens are randomly sampled from the dev set for computing RSA. A higher score indicates that the representation spaces before and after tuning are more similar.\n\nWhen adapting a pretrained language model (PrLM), adapter-based tuning inserts light-weight neural networks (adapters) between the transformer layers of the PrLM, and only updates the parameters of the adapters on a downstream task, but keeps the ones of the PrLM frozen.\nUnlike fine-tuning which introduces an entire new model for every task, one great advantage of adapter-based tuning is generating a compact model with only a few trainable parameters added per task.\n\nHoulsby et al. ( [2019])) have extensively studied the choices of adapter architectures and where they should be inserted into PrLMs. They find that a stack of down- and up-scale neural networks works well which only introduces a small amount of extra parameters to the network. This design inspires most of the following work Pfeiffer et al. ( [2020a]), [c])); Bapna and Firat ( [2019])). As shown in Figure [1]Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"), the adapter maps an input hidden vector hh\\\\mathrm{h} from dimension d𝑑d to dimension m𝑚m where m<d𝑚𝑑m<d, and then re-maps it to dimension d𝑑d. We refer m𝑚m as the hidden size of the adapter. A skip-connection is employed inside the adapter network such that if the parameters of the projection layers are near zeros, the adapter module approximates an identity function. Formally, given the input hidden vector hh\\\\mathrm{h}, the output vector h′superscripth′\\\\mathrm{h}^{\\\\prime} is calculated as:\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | h′=f2​(tanh⁡f1​(h))+hsuperscripth′subscript𝑓2subscript𝑓1hh\\\\mathrm{h}^{\\\\prime}=f\\_{2}(\\\\tanh{f\\_{1}(\\\\mathrm{h})})+\\\\mathrm{h} |  | (1) |\n\nin which f1​(⋅)subscript𝑓1⋅f\\_{1}(\\\\cdot) and f2​(⋅)subscript𝑓2⋅f\\_{2}(\\\\cdot) are the down- and up-projection layers. At each transformer layer, two adapters are inserted right after the self-attention and the feed-forward layers respectively. During adapter tuning, only the parameters of the adapters, the normalization layers, and the final classification layer are updated. We use the above described adapter configuration in all of our experiments, since it is adopted in most prior work with few modifications.\n\n### 2.2 Representation Similarity\n\nFine-tuning large-scale PrLMs on downstream tasks can suffer from overfitting and bad generalization issues Dodge et al. ( [2020])); Phang et al. ( [2018])). Recently, Lee et al. ( [2020])) propose Mixout to regularize the fine-tuning of PrLMs. They show that Mixout avoids catastrophic forgetting and stabilizes the fine-tuning process by encouraging the weights of the updated model to stay close to the initial weights. Since adapter-based tuning does not update the weights of PrLMs at all, we suspect that it has a similar effect of alleviating the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Since the weights of the PrLM are the same before and after adapter-based tuning, to verify this, we use Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) Laakso and Cottrell ( [2000]))\nto assess the similarity of tuned representations to those without tuning at each transformer layer.\n\nRSA has been widely used to analyze the similarity between two neural network outputs Abnar et al. ( [2019])); Chrupała and Alishahi ( [2019])); Merchant et al. ( [2020])), which works by\ncreating two comparable sets of representations by inputting a same set of n𝑛n samples to the two models.\nFor each set of representations, a n×n𝑛𝑛n\\\\times n pairwise similarity111Cosine similarity is used matrix is calculated. The final RSA similarity score between the two representation space is computed as the Pearson correlation between the flattened upper triangulars of the two similarity matrices. We use a subset of GLUE tasks Wang et al. ( [2018])) for our analysis. Given a task, we first perform adapter-based tuning and fine-tuning to adapt a BERT-base model (Mo​r​gsubscript𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑔M\\_{org}) to the target task, which yields models Ma​d​a​p​tsubscript𝑀𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑝𝑡M\\_{adapt} and Mf​tsubscript𝑀𝑓𝑡M\\_{ft} respectively (See Appendix [A.2]A.2 Experimental Details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") for training details). Then we pass sentences (or sentence-pairs depend on the task) from the development set to Mo​r​gsubscript𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑔M\\_{org}, Ma​d​a​p​tsubscript𝑀𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑝𝑡M\\_{adapt}, and Mf​tsubscript𝑀𝑓𝑡M\\_{ft} respectively.\nWe extract representations at each layer from the three models and select the corresponding representations of 5k randomly sampled tokens222We skip \\[PAD\\], \\[CLS\\], \\[SEP\\] for token selection. (n=5000𝑛5000n=5000) for evaluation. Note that the same set of tokens is used for all models. Finally, we compare the representations obtained from Ma​d​a​p​tsubscript𝑀𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑝𝑡M\\_{adapt} or Mf​tsubscript𝑀𝑓𝑡M\\_{ft} to those from Mo​r​gsubscript𝑀𝑜𝑟𝑔M\\_{org} using RSA.\n\nFigure [2]Figure 2 ‣ 2.1 Adapter-based Tuning ‣ 2 Adapter Better Regularizes Tuning ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") plots the results on STS-2, results of other tasks demonstrate a similar trend and can be found in Appendix [A.3]A.3 Additional Results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"). For both fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning, we observe that the representation change generally arises in the top layers of the network, which is consistent with previous findings that higher layers are more task relevant Howard and Ruder ( [2018])). It can be clearly observed that compared to fine-tuning, adapter-based tuning yields representations with less deviation from those of BERT-base at each layer, which verifies our claim that adapter-based tuning can better regularize the tuning process by mitigating the forgetting problem. Apparently, this property of adapter tuning comes from that it freezes all the parameters of PrLMs. And because of the skip-connection in the adapter, the hidden representation out of the adapter can mimic the input representation, in this way, some of the original knowledge of PrLMs (before injecting adapters) can be preserved.\n\nSince we find that adapter-based tuning better regularizes the learning process, the next question is how this property will help to improve the performance when adapting PrLMs to downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate this. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We compare fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning on monolingual text-level adaptation tasks in §§\\\\S [3]Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"), followed by cross-lingual adaptation in §§\\\\S [4]Cross-lingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\").

We refer this set of tasks as _Task Adaptation Evaluation_ (TAE). We observe that adapter-based tuning consistently outperforms fine-tuning on low-resource tasks, while they perform similarly on high-resource tasks. We further confirm the effectiveness of adapters in low-resource settings on the GLUE benchmark Wang et al.

Results with “†” are taken from Gururangan et al. ( [2020])). Results with “\\*” are reproduced by us. Numbers in () indicate the training size.\n\nTAE consists of four domains (biomedical, computer science, news text, and AMAZON reviews) and eight classification tasks (two in each domain), whose domain diversity makes it suitable to assess the adaptation effectiveness of different approaches. Detailed data statistics are displayed in Appendix [A.1]A.1 Datasets ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"). We consider tasks with fewer than 5k training examples as low-resource tasks and the others as high-resource tasks.\n\n#### Experimental Setup\n\nWe perform supervised fine-tuning on RoBERTa-base as our baseline (RoBa.-ft). For adapter-based tuning, we set the hidden size m𝑚m of adapters to 256 (RoBa.-adapter256).\nWe also present the results of adding _task-adaptive pretraining_ (+TAPT) Gururangan et al. ( [2020])). In this setting, before fine-tuning or adapter-based tuning, the model was trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective on the training texts (without labels) of the task. Note that in _RoBa.-adapter256+TAPT_, we also use adapter-based tuning for TAPT where only the weights of adapters are updated at the TAPT stage. This is to evaluate whether adapter-based tuning can work with unsupervised learning objectives. We follow the experimental settings in Gururangan et al. ( [2020])) for TAPT. For fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning, we train models for 20 epochs to make sure they are sufficiently trained and save the checkpoint after each training epoch. We select the checkpoint that achieves the best score on the validation set for evaluation on the test set. The batch size is set to 16 for both methods. The learning rate is set to 2e-5 for fine-tuning, and 1e-4 for adapter-based tuning.\nSee Appendix [A.2]A.2 Experimental Details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") for the hyperparameter selection process and more training details.\n\n#### Results\n\nTable [1]Table 1 ‣ 3.1 TAE ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") presents the comparison results. We report the average result over 5 runs with different random seeds. On four low-resource tasks, adapter-based tuning consistently outperforms fine-tuning and improves the average result by 1.9%. Adapter-based tuning alone without TAPT even outperforms fine-tuning with TAPT. Besides, adding TAPT before adapter-based tuning further improves the performance on 3 out of 4 low-resource tasks, which suggests that adapter-based tuning works with both supervised and unsupervised objectives.\nAnother finding is that when trained on high-resource tasks, both methods achieve similar results. To verify the effects of training size, on high-resource tasks, we plot the performances with varying numbers of training examples in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‣ Results ‣ 3.1 TAE ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"). The trend is consistent with our existing observations – adapter-based tuning achieves better results when the training set is small while fine-tuning will gradually catch up with an increasing number of training examples.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 3: Test performance w.r.t the number of training examples.

Results of MRPC and RTE in 5k setting are omitted as their training data is less than 5k. CoLA is evaluated using Matthew’s Correlation. MRPC and QQP are evaluated using F1 score. STS-B is evaluated using Spearman’s correlation. The other tasks are evaluated using accuracy. We report averages across five random seeds, with standard deviations as subscripts.\n\nTo further validate that adapters tend to generalize better than fine-tuning under low-resource settings, we follow Zhang et al. ( [2021])) to study low-resource adaptation using eight datasets from the GLUE benchmark Wang et al. ( [2018])) which covers four types of tasks: natural language inference (MNLI, QNLI, RTE), paraphrase detection (MRPC, QQP), sentiment classification (SST-2) and linguistic acceptability (CoLA). Appendix [A.1]A.1 Datasets ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") provides detailed data statistics and descriptions.\n\n#### Experimental Setup\n\nFor each dataset, we simulate two low-resource settings by randomly sampling 1k and 5k instances from the original training data as the new training sets. In each setting, we draw another 1k samples from the remaining training set as the validation set and instead use the original validation set as the test set, since the original GLUE test sets are not publicly available 333Users are limited to a maximum of two submissions per day to obtain test results, which is inconvenient for a large number of runs.\n\nWe perform fine-tuning on BERT-base (BERT-ft) and RoBERTa-base (RoBa.-ft) respectively as our baselines.\nWe set the learning rate to 2e-5 and the batch size to 16 for BERT and RoBERTa fine-tuning experiments (See Appendix [A.2]A.2 Experimental Details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") for details). For adapters, we only tune its hidden sizes in {64, 128, 256}, setting the learning rate to 1e-4 and batch size to 16 as the same used in §§\\\\S [3.1]TAE ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\").\n\n#### Results\n\nTable [2]Table 2 ‣ 3.2 GLUE Low-resource Adaptation ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") presents the comparison results. For adapter-based tuning, we report two results on each task. One is obtained with the optimal hidden size which varies per dataset, and the other is obtained with the size of 64. We observe that adapter-based tuning outperforms fine-tuning most of the time under both 1k and 5k settings. In particular, the performance gain is more significant in 1k setting, where on average across all tasks, adapter-based tuning outperforms fine-tuning by 2.5% and 0.7% on BERT and RoBERTa respectively.\n\n### 3.3 Discussions\n\nOne consistent observation from §§\\\\S [3.1]TAE ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") and §§\\\\S [3.2]GLUE Low-resource Adaptation ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") is that adapters tend to outperform fine-tuning on text-level classification tasks when the training set is small, but with more training samples, the benefit of adapters is less significant. In low-resource setting, fine-tuning has more severe overfitting problem, since it has much more tunable parameters compared to adapter-tuning, so adapter-tuning works better than fine-tuning. However, in high-resource setting, overfitting is not a big issue and model capacity counts more. Obviously, the model capacity under fine-tuning is larger than that under adapter-tuning since fine-tuning can update much more model parameters.\n\nWhen comparing the improvements of adapter tuning over fine-tuning on tasks from TAE (§§\\\\S [3.1]TAE ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\")) and GLUE (§§\\\\S [3.2]GLUE Low-resource Adaptation ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\")), we find that the improvement is more significant on low-resource tasks from TAE – on RoBERTa-base, the average improvement brought by adapters is 1.9% across four low-resource tasks from TAE, while the average improvement on GLUE is 0.7% and 0.4% in 1k and 5k settings respectively. As indicated in Gururangan et al. ( [2020])), the TAE dataset is more domain-specific and has less overlap with the corpus used for RoBERTa-base pretraining, one intuitive explanation for this observation is that fine-tuning has more severe forgetting and overfitting issues in domain adaptation where the target domain is dissimilar to the source domain in pretraining, thus adapter-based tuning is more preferable in this scenario.\n\n|  |  | POS |  |  | NER |  |  | XNLI |  |\n| Model | All | Target | Distant | All | Target | Distant | All | Target | Distant |\n| XLMR-ft Hu et al.

            "content": "In this section, we further compare fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning in the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer setting. All experiments in this section are based on XLM-R-large (Conneau et al., [2020a])), a recent SOTA multilingual PrLM covering 100 languages.\nWe conduct evaluations on a set of multilingual tasks from XTREME Hu et al. ( [2020])), including Universal Dependencies v2.5 tree banks (UD-POS) Nivre et al. ( [2018])), Wikiann NER Pan et al. ( [2017])), and cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) Conneau et al. ( [2020b])). UD-POS contains 34 languages, Wikiann NER contains 40 languages, and XNLI contains 15 languages. We refer the reader to Hu et al. ( [2020])) for additional details about the datasets.\n\n#### Experimental Setup\n\nOn each task, we perform hyperparameter tuning on the English development set. For both fine-tuning and adapter-based tuning, we use batch size 32, and tune the learning rates in {1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5, 4e-5, 5e-5}. For adapter-based tuning, we further tune the hidden sizes in {64, 128, 256} and find size 256 often performs the best. We train and select models with the English training and development sets and then evaluate the tuned models on test sets of all languages. See Appendix [A.2]A.2 Experimental Details ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") for hyperparameter and training details.\n\n#### Results\n\nTable [3]Table 3 ‣ 3.3 Discussions ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") summarizes the results.\nTo better compare cross-lingual transfer to different groups of languages, we present the average results of all languages (All), the target languages except English (Target), and the Non-Indo-European languages (Distant). It can be observed that adapter-based tuning significantly outperforms fine-tuning on all three settings for each task. Specifically, adapter-based tuning outperforms the reported fine-tuning results Hu et al. ( [2020])) on _Target_ and _Distant_ by 2.06% and 3.71% on UD-POS, 1.08% and 0.8% on Wikiann NER, and 0.87% and 0.87% on XNLI. See Appendix [A.3]A.3 Additional Results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") for detailed results on each language.\n\nNote that UD-POS, Wikiann NER, and XNLI are all high-resource tasks, with 20k, 20k, and 400k training samples respectively.\nUnlike monolingual tasks, adapters achieve consistent performance gains even under high-resource settings on cross-lingual tasks. We suspect that the ability to mitigate forgetting is more useful in cross-lingual scenarios since the model knowledge of the target languages only comes from pretraining. Adapter-based tuning can better maintain the knowledge.\nWe further investigate the effectiveness of adapter-based tuning on XNLI with smaller training sets. Table [4]Table 4 ‣ 3.3 Discussions ‣ 3 Monolingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") summarizes the results when trained on 5%, 10%, and 20% of the original training sets. In all settings, adapters still demonstrate consistent improvements over fine-tuning.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 4: Box plots of test performance distribution over 20 runs across different learning rates.

            "content": "#### Adapter Hidden Size\n\nThe hidden size m𝑚m444The fraction of adapter parameters w.r.t. BERT-base (110M parameters) is 2%, 4%, and 6% when m𝑚m is set to 64, 128, and 256. The fraction w.r.t. XLMR-large (550M parameters) is 1%, 2%, and 3%, respectively. is the only adapter-specific hyperparameter. As indicated in Houlsby et al. ( [2019])), the hidden size provides a simple means to trade off performance with parameter efficiency. Table [5]Table 5 ‣ Results ‣ 4 Cross-lingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") shows the performance with different hidden sizes, from which we find that increasing the hidden size may not always lead to performance gains. For monolingual low-resource adaptation, TAE tasks prefer a larger hidden size, while the results on GLUE are similar across different hidden sizes. We suspect that this is due to that TAE datasets are more dissimilar to the pretraining corpus, which requires relatively more trainable parameters to learn the domain-specific knowledge. On XNLI, a larger hidden size helps improve the performance when the full data is used. However, when only 5% training data is used, increasing the hidden size does not yield consistent improvements. The results indicate that the optimal hidden size depends on both the domain and the training size of the task.\n\n#### Learning Rate Robustness\n\nWe compare the two tuning methods in terms of their stability w.r.t the learning rate. Figure [4]Figure 4 ‣ Results ‣ 4 Cross-lingual Adaptation ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") shows the performance distributions on CoLA and MNLI under 1k and 5k settings. The learning rates are varied in {2e-5, 4e-5, 6e-5, 8e-5, 1e-4}. Each box in the plot is drawn from the results of 20 runs with different random seeds. We observe that fine-tuning yields larger variances when increasing the learning rates. It often collapses with learning rates larger than 4e-5 when RoBERTa-base is used. Adapter-based tuning is more stable across a wider range of learning rates.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Loss on the dev set w.r.t training steps. Results are based on BERT-base.

We use CoLA, MRPC, QNLI, and SST-2 with their original training and development sets for our analysis. The CoLA and MRPC contain 8.5k and 3.7k training samples and are regarded as low-resource tasks. The QNLI and SST-2 contain 104k and 67k training samples and are used as high-resource tasks. We train the two low-resource tasks for 10k steps, and the high resource tasks for 60k steps with a batch size of 16. We use BERT-base for all experiments. Figure [5]Figure 5 ‣ Learning Rate Robustness ‣ 5 Analysis ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") plots the loss curves on dev sets w.r.t training steps. We observe that models with fine-tuning can easily overfit on both low- and high-resource tasks. Adapter-based tuning is more robust to overfitting. Additional results on accuracy w.r.t. training steps and a similar analysis on XNLI are in Appendix [A.3]A.3 Additional Results ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\").\n\nWe also present the mean and best dev results across all evaluation steps in Table [6]Table 6 ‣ Learning Rate Robustness ‣ 5 Analysis ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"), where we perform an evaluation step every 20 training steps. The mean results of adapter-based tuning consistently outperform those of fine-tuning. The differences between the mean and the best values are also smaller with adapter-based tuning. The results suggest that the performance of adapters is more stable over fine-tuning along the training process.\n\nTraining neural networks can be viewed as searching for a good minima in the non-convex landscape defined by the loss function. Prior work Hochreiter and Schmidhuber ( [1997])); Li et al. ( [2018])) shows that the flatness of a local minima correlates with the generalization capability.\nThus, we further show the loss landscapes of the two tuning methods. Following Hao et al. ( [2019])), we plot the loss curve by linear interpolation between θ0subscript𝜃0\\\\theta\\_{0} and θ1subscript𝜃1\\\\theta\\_{1} with function f​(α)=ℒ​(θ0+α⋅(θ1−θ0))𝑓𝛼ℒsubscript𝜃0⋅𝛼subscript𝜃1subscript𝜃0f(\\\\alpha)=\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta\\_{0}+\\\\alpha\\\\cdot(\\\\theta\\_{1}-\\\\theta\\_{0})), where θ0subscript𝜃0\\\\theta\\_{0} and θ1subscript𝜃1\\\\theta\\_{1} denote the model weights before and after tuning. ℒ​(θ)ℒ𝜃\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\theta) is the loss function and α𝛼\\\\alpha is a scalar parameter. In our experiments, we set the range of α𝛼\\\\alpha to \\[−2,2\\]22\\[-2,2\\] and uniformly sample 20 points. Figure [6]Figure 6 ‣ Overfitting and Generalization ‣ 5 Analysis ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\") shows the loss landscape curves on CoLA and SST based on BERT-base. It shows that the minimas of adapter-based tuning are more wide and flat, which indicates that adapter-based tuning tends to generalize better.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 6: Loss landscapes. BERT-base is used.\n\n#### Compare to Mixout\n\n| Model | CoLA | MRPC | QNLI | SST-2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| finetune | 41.39 | 83.56 | 80.51 | 87.84 |\n| finetune-mixout | 42.35 | 84.00 | 80.03 | 87.71 |\n| Adapter64 | 42.93 | 84.79 | 80.54 | 88.02 |\n| Adapter64-mixout | 42.52 | 83.80 | 80.67 | 87.66 |\n\nTable 7: Comparison with Mixout. Results are based on BERT-base under 1k settiing. Average results across 5 random seeds are reported.\n\nThe focus of this paper is to answer the question – besides being parameter-efficient, when would adapter-based tuning be more effective than fine-tuning for PrLM adaptation? Thus, we only use fine-tuning as our primary baseline in previous sections. Here, for the sake of curiosity, we further compare adapter-based tuning to fine-tuning regularized by _mixout_ Lee et al. ( [2020])) on a subset of GLUE tasks, since _mixout_ similarly regularizes the learning process by mitigating the forgetting issue. Specifically, it replaces all outgoing parameters from a randomly selected neuron to the corresponding parameters of the initial model without tuning, such that it reduces divergence from the initial model. Following the suggestions in the paper, we conduct experiments by replacing all _dropout_ modules in the network with _mixout_ and set the mixout probability to 0.90.90.9. From the results in Table [7]Table 7 ‣ Compare to Mixout ‣ 5 Analysis ‣ On the Effectiveness of Adapter-based Tuning for Pretrained Language Model Adaptation\"), we find that using adapter-based tuning alone yields the best results in most cases. Applying _mixout_ to fine-tuning improves the performance on CoLA and MRPC only. However, applying it to adapters instead tends to degrade the performance. We suspect that this is because the number of trainable parameters of adapters is very few to begin with. Hence, further replacing a large percentage of them with their initial weights may weaken the learning ability.",

            "content": "Fine-tuning pretrained large scale language models has proven its effectiveness on a wide range of NLP tasks (Devlin et al., [2019]); Liu et al., [2019]); Conneau et al., [2020a]); Brown et al., [2020])). However, fine-tuning requires a new set of weights for each task, which is parameter inefficient. Adapter-based tuning is proposed to deal with this problem Houlsby et al. ( [2019])). Most previous work has demonstrated that it achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning Bapna and Firat ( [2019])); Pfeiffer et al. ( [2020b]), [a]), [c])); Rücklé et al. ( [2020])); Wang et al. ( [2020])); Guo et al. ( [2020])). However, existing work mostly focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect while overlooks the effectiveness.\n\nFine-tuning PrLMs in a low-resource setting has been studied for a while Dodge et al. ( [2020])); Lee et al. ( [2020])); Phang et al. ( [2018])); Jiang et al. ( [2020])); Zhang et al. ( [2021])). Previous work points out that with large-scale parameters, fine-tuning on a few samples can lead to overfitting and bad generalization, which causes the results unstable. Phang et al. ( [2018])) find that pretraining on an intermediate task can improve fine-tuning outcomes. Jiang et al. ( [2020])) improve the robustness of fine-tuning by controlling the model complexity and preventing aggressive updating.\nOn the other hand, catastrophic forgetting can appear when transferring a pretrained neural networks French ( [1999])); McCloskey and Cohen ( [1989])); Goodfellow et al. ( [2013])), where the learned knowledge from pretraining is lost when adapting to downstream tasks. This phenomenon often appears in NLP tasks Mou et al. ( [2016])); Arora et al. ( [2019])). To relieve this problem of adapting pretrained language models, Howard and Ruder ( [2018])) gradually unfreeze the layers starting from the last layer and Sun et al. ( [2019])) find assigning lower learning rate to the bottom layers can improve the performance. Lee et al. ( [2020])) regularize learning by encouraging the weights of the updated model to stay close to the initial weights. Aghajanyan et al. ( [2021])) regularize fine-tuning by introducing noise to the input which is similar to adversarial training for fine-tuning studied in Zhu et al. ( [2020])). Mosbach et al. ( [2021])) point out that the instability of fine-tuning lies in the optimizer and propose to revise the Adam optimizer by replacing it with a de-bias version. Chen et al. ( [2020])) propose a mechanism to recall the knowledge from pretraining tasks.",

            "content": "Prior work often focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect while overlooks the effectiveness of adapter-based tuning. We empirically demonstrate that adapter-based tuning can better regularize the learning process. We conduct extensive experiments to verify its effectiveness and conclude that 1) it tends to outperform fine-tuning on both low-resource and cross-lingual tasks; 2) it demonstrates higher stability under different learning rates compared to fine-tuning. We hope our study will inspire more future work on PrLM adaptation based on adapters and other methods that only tune part of the PrLM parameters.",

        "abstract": "Adapter-based tuning has recently arisen as an alternative to fine-tuning. It\nworks by adding light-weight adapter modules to a pretrained language model\n(PrLM) and only updating the parameters of adapter modules when learning on a\ndownstream task. As such, it adds only a few trainable parameters per new task,\nallowing a high degree of parameter sharing. Prior studies have shown that\nadapter-based tuning often achieves comparable results to fine-tuning. However,\nexisting work only focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect of adapter-based\ntuning while lacking further investigation on its effectiveness. In this paper,\nwe study the latter. We first show that adapter-based tuning better mitigates\nforgetting issues than fine-tuning since it yields representations with less\ndeviation from those generated by the initial PrLM. We then empirically compare\nthe two tuning methods on several downstream NLP tasks and settings. We\ndemonstrate that 1) adapter-based tuning outperforms fine-tuning on\nlow-resource and cross-lingual tasks; 2) it is more robust to overfitting and\nless sensitive to changes in learning rates."
