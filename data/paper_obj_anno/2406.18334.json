The computational cost of approximation increases with an ever-increasing size of data and model parameters. Many heuristics have been proposed to approximate post-hoc explanations efficiently. This paper shows that the standard i.i.d. sampling used in a broad spectrum of algorithms for explanation estimation leads to an approximation error worthy of improvement. To this end, we introduce _compress then explain_ (cte), a new paradigm for more efficient and accurate explanation estimation. cte uses distribution compression through kernel thinning to obtain a data sample that best approximates the marginal distribution. We show that cte improves the estimation of removal-based local and global explanations with negligible computational overhead. It often achieves an on-par explanation approximation error using 2–3×\\\\times less samples, i.e. requiring 2–3×\\\\times less model evaluations. cte is a simple, yet powerful, plug-in for any explanation method that now relies on i.i.d. sampling.\n\nexplainable artificial intelligence, feature attributions, sage, sampling, coreset, kernel thinning\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nComputationally efficient estimation of post-hoc explanations is at the forefront of current research on explainable machine learning (strumbelj2010efficient; covert2021improving; slack2021reliable; jethani2022fastshap; chen2023algorithms; donnelly2023rashomon; muschalik2024beyond).\nThe majority of the work focuses on improving efficiency with respect to the dimension of features (covert2020understanding; jethani2022fastshap; chen2023algorithms; fumagalli2023shapiq), specific model classes like neural networks (erion2021improving) and decision trees (muschalik2024beyond), or approximating the conditional feature distribution (chen2018learning; aas2021explaining; olsen2022using; olsen2024comparative).\n\nHowever, in many practical settings, a marginal feature distribution is used instead to estimate explanations, and i.i.d. samples from the data typically form the so-called _background data_ samples, also known as _reference points_ or _baselines_, which plays a crucial role in the estimation process (lundberg2017unified; covert2020understanding; scholbeck2020sampling; erion2021improving; ghalebikesabi2021locality; lundstrom2022rigorous).\nFor example, covert2020understanding mention “ _\\[O\\]ur sampling approximation for SAGE was run using draws from the marginal distribution._\n_We used a fixed set of 512 background samples \\[…\\]_” and we provide more such quotes in Appendix LABEL:app:motivation-quotes to motivate our research question: _Can we reliably improve on standard i.i.d. sampling in explanation estimation?_\n\nWe make a connection to research on statistical theory, where kernel thinning (kt, dwivedi2021kernel; dwivedi2022generalized) was introduced to compress a distribution more effectively than with i.i.d. sampling.\nkt has an efficient implementation in the compress\\+\\+ algorithm (shetty2022distribution) and was applied to improve statistical kernel testing (domingo2023compress).\nBuilding on this line of work, this paper aims to thoroughly quantify the error introduced by the current _sample then explain_ paradigm in feature marginalization, which is involved in the estimation of both local and global removal-based explanations (covert2021explaining).\nWe propose an efficient way to reduce this approximation error based on distribution compression (Figure [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2406.18334#S1.F1 \"Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Efficient and Accurate Explanation Estimation with Distribution Compression\")).\nWe refer the reader to the arguments provided in (herrmann2024position) concerning the added value of conducting such empirical research in machine learning.\nNamely, the research question is rather open and we aim to gain insight into a previously unexplored area.\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2406.18334/assets/x1.png)Figure 1: Garbage sample in, garbage explanation out. _Sample then explain_ is a conventional approach to decrease the computational cost of explanation estimation.

slack2021reliable; li2021learning; ghalebikesabi2021locality; li2023glime), or _how to efficiently sample feature coalitions_(chen2018learning; covert2021improving; fumagalli2023shapiq).\nInstead of generating samples from the conditional distribution itself, which is challenging (olsen2022using), we explore how to efficiently select an appropriate subset of background data for explanations (hase2021outofdistribution; lundstrom2022rigorous).\nSpecifically for Shapley-based explanations, jethani2022fastshap propose to predict them with a learned surrogate model, while kolpaczki2024approximating propose their representation detached from the notion of marginal contribution.\nWe aim to propose a general paradigm shift that would benefit a broader class of explanation methods including feature effects (apley2020visualizing;

harpeled2004coresets) and active learning (sener2018active), as well as dataset distillation (wang2018dataset) and dataset condensation (zhao2021dataset; kim2022dataset) that create synthetic samples to improve the efficiency of model training.\n\n## 2 Preliminaries\n\nWe aim to explain a prediction model trained on labeled data and denoted by f:𝒳↦ℝ:𝑓maps-to𝒳ℝf:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} where 𝒳𝒳\\\\mathcal{X} is the feature space; it predicts an output using an input feature vector 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x}.\nUsually, we assume 𝒳⊆ℝd𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nWithout loss of generality, in the case of classification, we explain the output of a single class as a posterior probability from \\[0,1\\]01\\[0,1\\].\nWe usually also assume a given dataset {(𝐱(1),y(1)),…,(𝐱(n),y(n))}superscript𝐱1superscript𝑦1…superscript𝐱𝑛superscript𝑦𝑛\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(1)},y^{(1)}),\\\\ldots,(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)},y^{(n)})\\\\}, where every element comes from 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y}, the underlying feature and label space, on which the explanation are computed.\nDepending on the explanation method, this can be a training or test dataset, and it could also be provided without labels.\nWe denote the n×d𝑛𝑑n\\\\times d dimensional data matrix by 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} where 𝐱(i)superscript𝐱𝑖\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} appears in the i𝑖i-th row of 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X}, which is assumed to be sampled in an i.i.d. fashion from an underlying distribution p​(𝐱,y)𝑝𝐱𝑦p(\\\\mathbf{x},y) defined on 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y}.\nWe denote a random vector as 𝐗∈𝒳𝐗𝒳\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}.\nFurther, let s⊂{1,…,d}𝑠1…𝑑s\\\\subset\\\\{1,\\\\dots,d\\\\} be a feature index set of interest with its complement s¯={1,…,d}∖s¯𝑠1…𝑑𝑠\\\\bar{s}=\\\\{1,\\\\dots,d\\\\}\\\\setminus s.\nWe index feature vectors 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x} and random variables 𝐗𝐗\\\\mathbf{X} by index sets s𝑠s to restrict them to these index sets.\nWe write p𝐗​(𝐱)subscript𝑝𝐗𝐱p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) and p𝐗s​(𝐱s)subscript𝑝subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}) for marginal distributions on 𝐗𝐗\\\\mathbf{X} and 𝐗ssubscript𝐗𝑠\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}, respectively, and p𝐗s\\|𝐗t​(𝐱s\\|𝐱t)subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐗𝑡conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐱𝑡p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t}) for conditional distribution on 𝐗s\\|𝐗tconditionalsubscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐗𝑡\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}.\nWe use q𝕏subscript𝑞𝕏q\\_{\\\\mathbb{X}} to denote an empirical distribution approximating p𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}} based on a data matrix 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X}.\n\n### Sampling from the data matrix is prevalent in explanation estimation.\n\nVarious estimators of post-hoc explanations sample from the data matrix to efficiently approximate the explanation estimate (Appendix LABEL:app:motivation-quotes).\nFor example, many removal-based explanations (covert2021explaining) like shap(lundberg2017unified) and sage(covert2020understanding) rely on marginalizing features out of the model function f𝑓f using their joint conditional distribution 𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]=∫f​(𝐱s,𝐱s¯)​p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s)​𝑑𝐱s¯.subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠differential-dsubscript𝐱¯𝑠\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\]=\\\\int f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s})d\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}.\n\nNote that the practical approximation of the conditional distribution p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s)subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}) itself is challenging (chen2018learning; aas2021explaining; olsen2022using) and there is no ideal solution to this problem (see a recent benchmark by olsen2024comparative).\nIn fact, in (covert2020understanding, Appendix D), it is mentioned that the default for sage is to assume feature independence and use the marginal distribution p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s):-p𝐗s¯​(𝐱s¯):-subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s})\\\\coloneq p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}); so does the kernel-shap estimator (a practical implementation of shap, lundberg2017unified). This trend continues in more recent work (fumagalli2023shapiq; krzyzinski2023survshap).\n\n###### Definition 2.1(Feature marginalization).\n\nGiven a set of observed values 𝐱ssubscript𝐱𝑠\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}, we define a model function with marginalized features from the set s¯¯𝑠\\\\bar{s} as f​(𝐱s;p𝐗):-𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]:-𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝑝𝐗subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s};p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}})\\\\coloneq\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\].\n\nIn practice, the expectation 𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\] is estimated by i.i.d. sampling from the dataset 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} that approximates the distribution p𝐗s¯​(𝐱s¯)subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}).\nThis sampled set of points forms the so-called _background data_, aka _reference points_, or _baselines_ as specifically in case of the expected-gradients(erion2021improving) explanation method defined as expected-gradients​(𝐱):-𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗,α∼U​(0,1)​\\[(𝐱−𝐗)⋅∂f​(𝐗+α⋅(𝐱−𝐗))∂𝐱\\].:-expected-gradients𝐱subscript𝔼formulae-sequencesimilar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗similar-to𝛼𝑈01delimited-\\[\\]⋅𝐱𝐗𝑓𝐗⋅𝛼𝐱𝐗𝐱\\\\textsc{expected-gradients}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\coloneq\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}},\\\\alpha\\\\sim U(0,1)}\\\\left\\[(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{X})\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\mathbf{X}+\\\\alpha\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{X}))}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right\\].\n\nFurthermore, i.i.d. sampling is used in global explanation methods, which typically are an _aggregation_ of local explanations.\nTo improve the computational efficiency of these approximations, often only a subset of 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} is considered; called _foreground data_. Examples include: feature-effects explanations (apley2020visualizing), an aggregation of lime(ribeiro2016should) into g-lime(li2023glime), and again sage(covert2021improving), for which points from 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} require to have their corresponding labels y𝑦y.\n\n### Background on distribution compression.\n\nStandard sampling strategies can be inefficient. For example, the Monte Carlo estimate 1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) of an unknown expectation 𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗​h​(𝐗)subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗ℎ𝐗\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X}) based on n𝑛n i.i.d. points has Θ​(1/n)Θ1𝑛\\\\Theta(1/\\\\sqrt{n}) integration error \\|𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗​h​(𝐗)−1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))\\|subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗ℎ𝐗1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖\\\\big{\\|}\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X})-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\\\\big{\\|} requiring 102superscript10210^{2} points for 10%percent\\\\% relative error and 104superscript10410^{4} points for 1%percent\\\\% error (shetty2022distribution).\nTo improve on i.i.d. sampling, given a sequence 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} of n𝑛n input points summarizing a target distribution p𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}, the goal of distribution compression is to identify a high quality _coreset_ 𝕏~~𝕏\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathbb{X}} of size n~≪nmuch-less-than~𝑛𝑛\\\\tilde{n}\\\\ll n.\nThis quality is measured with the coreset’s integration error \\|1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))−1n~​∑i=1n~h​(𝐱~(i))\\|1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖1~𝑛subscriptsuperscript~𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript~𝐱𝑖\\\\big{\\|}\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tilde{n}}\\\\sum^{\\\\tilde{n}}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(i)})\\\\big{\\|} for functions hℎh in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a given kernel function 𝐤𝐤\\\\mathbf{k}(muandet2017kernel).\nThe recently introduced kt algorithm (dwivedi2021kernel; dwivedi2022generalized) returns such a coreset that minimizes the kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD𝐤subscriptMMD𝐤\\\\mathrm{MMD}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}}, gretton2012kernel).\n\n###### Definition 2.2(Kernel maximum mean discrepancy (gretton2012kernel; dwivedi2021kernel)).\n\nLet 𝐤:ℝd×ℝd↦ℝ:𝐤maps-tosuperscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑ℝ\\\\mathbf{k}:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} be a bounded kernel function with 𝐤​(𝐱,⋅)𝐤𝐱⋅\\\\mathbf{k}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\cdot) measurable for all 𝐱∈ℝd𝐱superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, e.g. a Gaussian kernel.

      "content": "We aim to explain a prediction model trained on labeled data and denoted by f:𝒳↦ℝ:𝑓maps-to𝒳ℝf:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} where 𝒳𝒳\\\\mathcal{X} is the feature space; it predicts an output using an input feature vector 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x}.\nUsually, we assume 𝒳⊆ℝd𝒳superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}.\nWithout loss of generality, in the case of classification, we explain the output of a single class as a posterior probability from \\[0,1\\]01\\[0,1\\].\nWe usually also assume a given dataset {(𝐱(1),y(1)),…,(𝐱(n),y(n))}superscript𝐱1superscript𝑦1…superscript𝐱𝑛superscript𝑦𝑛\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(1)},y^{(1)}),\\\\ldots,(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(n)},y^{(n)})\\\\}, where every element comes from 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y}, the underlying feature and label space, on which the explanation are computed.\nDepending on the explanation method, this can be a training or test dataset, and it could also be provided without labels.\nWe denote the n×d𝑛𝑑n\\\\times d dimensional data matrix by 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} where 𝐱(i)superscript𝐱𝑖\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)} appears in the i𝑖i-th row of 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X}, which is assumed to be sampled in an i.i.d. fashion from an underlying distribution p​(𝐱,y)𝑝𝐱𝑦p(\\\\mathbf{x},y) defined on 𝒳×𝒴𝒳𝒴\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Y}.\nWe denote a random vector as 𝐗∈𝒳𝐗𝒳\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}.\nFurther, let s⊂{1,…,d}𝑠1…𝑑s\\\\subset\\\\{1,\\\\dots,d\\\\} be a feature index set of interest with its complement s¯={1,…,d}∖s¯𝑠1…𝑑𝑠\\\\bar{s}=\\\\{1,\\\\dots,d\\\\}\\\\setminus s.\nWe index feature vectors 𝐱𝐱\\\\mathbf{x} and random variables 𝐗𝐗\\\\mathbf{X} by index sets s𝑠s to restrict them to these index sets.\nWe write p𝐗​(𝐱)subscript𝑝𝐗𝐱p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) and p𝐗s​(𝐱s)subscript𝑝subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}) for marginal distributions on 𝐗𝐗\\\\mathbf{X} and 𝐗ssubscript𝐗𝑠\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}, respectively, and p𝐗s\\|𝐗t​(𝐱s\\|𝐱t)subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐗𝑡conditionalsubscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐱𝑡p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{t}) for conditional distribution on 𝐗s\\|𝐗tconditionalsubscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐗𝑡\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{t}.\nWe use q𝕏subscript𝑞𝕏q\\_{\\\\mathbb{X}} to denote an empirical distribution approximating p𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}} based on a data matrix 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X}.\n\n### Sampling from the data matrix is prevalent in explanation estimation.\n\nVarious estimators of post-hoc explanations sample from the data matrix to efficiently approximate the explanation estimate (Appendix LABEL:app:motivation-quotes).\nFor example, many removal-based explanations (covert2021explaining) like shap(lundberg2017unified) and sage(covert2020understanding) rely on marginalizing features out of the model function f𝑓f using their joint conditional distribution 𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]=∫f​(𝐱s,𝐱s¯)​p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s)​𝑑𝐱s¯.subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠differential-dsubscript𝐱¯𝑠\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\]=\\\\int f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s})d\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}.\n\nNote that the practical approximation of the conditional distribution p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s)subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}) itself is challenging (chen2018learning; aas2021explaining; olsen2022using) and there is no ideal solution to this problem (see a recent benchmark by olsen2024comparative).\nIn fact, in (covert2020understanding, Appendix D), it is mentioned that the default for sage is to assume feature independence and use the marginal distribution p𝐗s¯\\|𝐗s=𝐱s​(𝐱s¯\\|𝐱s):-p𝐗s¯​(𝐱s¯):-subscript𝑝conditionalsubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐗𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠conditionalsubscript𝐱¯𝑠subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{s}=\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s})\\\\coloneq p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}); so does the kernel-shap estimator (a practical implementation of shap, lundberg2017unified). This trend continues in more recent work (fumagalli2023shapiq; krzyzinski2023survshap).\n\n###### Definition 2.1(Feature marginalization).\n\nGiven a set of observed values 𝐱ssubscript𝐱𝑠\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s}, we define a model function with marginalized features from the set s¯¯𝑠\\\\bar{s} as f​(𝐱s;p𝐗):-𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]:-𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝑝𝐗subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s};p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}})\\\\coloneq\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\].\n\nIn practice, the expectation 𝔼𝐗s¯∼p𝐗s¯​\\[f​(𝐱s,𝐗s¯)\\]subscript𝔼similar-tosubscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠delimited-\\[\\]𝑓subscript𝐱𝑠subscript𝐗¯𝑠\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}}\\\\left\\[f(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{s},\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}})\\\\right\\] is estimated by i.i.d. sampling from the dataset 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} that approximates the distribution p𝐗s¯​(𝐱s¯)subscript𝑝subscript𝐗¯𝑠subscript𝐱¯𝑠p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}}(\\\\mathbf{x}\\_{\\\\bar{s}}).\nThis sampled set of points forms the so-called _background data_, aka _reference points_, or _baselines_ as specifically in case of the expected-gradients(erion2021improving) explanation method defined as expected-gradients​(𝐱):-𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗,α∼U​(0,1)​\\[(𝐱−𝐗)⋅∂f​(𝐗+α⋅(𝐱−𝐗))∂𝐱\\].:-expected-gradients𝐱subscript𝔼formulae-sequencesimilar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗similar-to𝛼𝑈01delimited-\\[\\]⋅𝐱𝐗𝑓𝐗⋅𝛼𝐱𝐗𝐱\\\\textsc{expected-gradients}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\coloneq\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}},\\\\alpha\\\\sim U(0,1)}\\\\left\\[(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{X})\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\partial f(\\\\mathbf{X}+\\\\alpha\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{X}))}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}\\\\right\\].\n\nFurthermore, i.i.d. sampling is used in global explanation methods, which typically are an _aggregation_ of local explanations.\nTo improve the computational efficiency of these approximations, often only a subset of 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} is considered; called _foreground data_. Examples include: feature-effects explanations (apley2020visualizing), an aggregation of lime(ribeiro2016should) into g-lime(li2023glime), and again sage(covert2021improving), for which points from 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} require to have their corresponding labels y𝑦y.\n\n### Background on distribution compression.\n\nStandard sampling strategies can be inefficient. For example, the Monte Carlo estimate 1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) of an unknown expectation 𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗​h​(𝐗)subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗ℎ𝐗\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X}) based on n𝑛n i.i.d. points has Θ​(1/n)Θ1𝑛\\\\Theta(1/\\\\sqrt{n}) integration error \\|𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗​h​(𝐗)−1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))\\|subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗ℎ𝐗1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖\\\\big{\\|}\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X})-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\\\\big{\\|} requiring 102superscript10210^{2} points for 10%percent\\\\% relative error and 104superscript10410^{4} points for 1%percent\\\\% error (shetty2022distribution).\nTo improve on i.i.d. sampling, given a sequence 𝕏𝕏\\\\mathbb{X} of n𝑛n input points summarizing a target distribution p𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}, the goal of distribution compression is to identify a high quality _coreset_ 𝕏~~𝕏\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathbb{X}} of size n~≪nmuch-less-than~𝑛𝑛\\\\tilde{n}\\\\ll n.\nThis quality is measured with the coreset’s integration error \\|1n​∑i=1nh​(𝐱(i))−1n~​∑i=1n~h​(𝐱~(i))\\|1𝑛subscriptsuperscript𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript𝐱𝑖1~𝑛subscriptsuperscript~𝑛𝑖1ℎsuperscript~𝐱𝑖\\\\big{\\|}\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum^{n}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tilde{n}}\\\\sum^{\\\\tilde{n}}\\_{i=1}h(\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf{x}}^{(i)})\\\\big{\\|} for functions hℎh in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a given kernel function 𝐤𝐤\\\\mathbf{k}(muandet2017kernel).\nThe recently introduced kt algorithm (dwivedi2021kernel; dwivedi2022generalized) returns such a coreset that minimizes the kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD𝐤subscriptMMD𝐤\\\\mathrm{MMD}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}}, gretton2012kernel).\n\n###### Definition 2.2(Kernel maximum mean discrepancy (gretton2012kernel; dwivedi2021kernel)).\n\nLet 𝐤:ℝd×ℝd↦ℝ:𝐤maps-tosuperscriptℝ𝑑superscriptℝ𝑑ℝ\\\\mathbf{k}:\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb{R} be a bounded kernel function with 𝐤​(𝐱,⋅)𝐤𝐱⋅\\\\mathbf{k}(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\cdot) measurable for all 𝐱∈ℝd𝐱superscriptℝ𝑑\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, e.g. a Gaussian kernel. Kernel maximum mean discrepancy between probability distributions p,q𝑝𝑞p,q on ℝdsuperscriptℝ𝑑\\\\mathbb{R}^{d} is defined as MMD𝐤​(p,q):-suph∈ℋ𝐤:∥h∥𝐤≤1\\|𝔼𝐗∼p𝐗​h​(𝐗)−𝔼𝐗∼q𝐗​h​(𝐗)\\|,:-subscriptMMD𝐤𝑝𝑞subscriptsupremum:ℎsubscriptℋ𝐤subscriptdelimited-∥∥ℎ𝐤1subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑝𝐗ℎ𝐗subscript𝔼similar-to𝐗subscript𝑞𝐗ℎ𝐗\\\\mathrm{MMD}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}}(p,q)\\\\coloneq\\\\sup\\_{h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}}:\\\\left\\\\lVert h\\\\right\\\\rVert\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}}\\\\leq 1}\\\\big{\\|}\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim p\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X})-\\\\mathbb{E}\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim q\\_{\\\\mathbf{X}}}h(\\\\mathbf{X})\\\\big{\\|}, where ℋ𝐤subscriptℋ𝐤\\\\mathcal{H}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}} is a reproducing kernel Hilbert induced by 𝐤𝐤\\\\mathbf{k}.\n\nAn unbiased empirical estimate of MMD𝐤subscriptMMD𝐤\\\\mathrm{MMD}\\_{\\\\mathbf{k}} can be relatively easily computed given a kernel function 𝐤𝐤\\\\mathbf{k}(gretton2012kernel).\ncompress++ (shetty2022distribution) is an efficient algorithm for kt that returns a coreset of size n𝑛\\\\sqrt{n} in 𝒪​(n​log3⁡n)𝒪𝑛superscript3𝑛\\\\mathcal{O}(n\\\\log^{3}{n}) time and 𝒪​(n​log2⁡n)𝒪𝑛superscript2𝑛\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\log^{2}{n}) space, making kt viable for large datasets.\nIt was adapted to improve the kernel two-sample test (domingo2023compress).",
