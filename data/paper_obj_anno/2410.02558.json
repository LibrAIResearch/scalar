The tree structure in the top-right shows the simplified constituent structure for illustration purposes. Constituent strings are highlighted in blue.\n\nMaximizing sentence log-likelihood has traditionally been the primary training objective for unsupervised constituency parsers (Eisner, [2016](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib11 \"\"); Kim et al., [2019a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib16 \"\")).\nHowever, Log-Likelihood (LL), the objective function, does not explicitly factor in the syntax-semantics alignment.\nThis leads to a poor correlation between the LL value and the parsing accuracy, which we will discuss further in Section [5.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.SS3 \"5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nAs pointed out in previous research, training a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) parser that outperforms trivial baselines with the LL maximization objective is challenging (Carroll & Charniak, [1992](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib7 \"\"); Kim et al., [2019a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib16 \"\")).\nSuccessful training commonly involves altering the LL maximization objective, such as imposing sparsity constraints (Cohen et al., [2008](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib10 \"\"); Johnson et al., [2007](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib15 \"\")) or heuristically estimating the LL value (Spitkovsky et al., [2010](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib32 \"\")).\nEvidence suggests that the LL function might not provide robust information to distinguish between constituents and non-constituents, rendering LL an insufficient objective function for unsupervised parsing.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel objective for unsupervised constituency parsing: maximizing the semantic information that constituent structures carry.\nWe propose a novel method for measuring _SemInfo_, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics.\nSpecifically, we introduce a bag-of-substrings model to represent the sentence semantics and quantify semantic information encoded in each substring using the probability-weighted information metric developed for bag-of-words models (Aizawa, [2003](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib1 \"\")).\nWe calculate the SemInfo value by aggregating the substring-semantic information associated with the constituent structure.\nExperiments show a much stronger correlation between SemInfo and the parsing accuracy than the correlation between LL and the parsing accuracy, suggesting that SemInfo is an effective objective function for unsupervised constituency parsing.\nIn addition, we develop a Tree Conditional Random Field (TreeCRF)-based model to apply the SemInfo maximization objective to PCFG induction, the state-of-the-art method for unsupervised constituency parsing.\nExperiments demonstrate that the SemInfo maximization objective improves the PCFG‚Äôs parsing accuracy by 7.85 points across five latest PCFG variants and in four languages.\n\nOur main contributions are: (1) Proposing a novel method for estimating SemInfo, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics. (2) Demonstrating a strong correlation between SemInfo values and parsing accuracy. (3) Developing a TreeCRF model to apply the SemInfo maximization objective to PCFG induction, significantly improving parsing accuracy and setting new state-of-the-art results in three of the four languages tested.\n\n## 2 Background\n\nThe idea that constituent structures reflect the organization of sentence semantics is central to modern linguistic studies (Steedman, [2000](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib33 \"\"); Pollard & Sag, [1987](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib25 \"\")).\nA constituent is a substring sùë†s in a sentence xùë•x that can function independently (Carnie, [2007](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib6 \"\")) and carries individual meaning (Heim & Kratzer, [1998](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib14 \"\")).\nA collection of constituents forms a tree-shaped structure tùë°t, which we can represent as a collection of its constituent strings t={s1,s2,‚Ä¶}ùë°subscriptùë†1subscriptùë†2‚Ä¶t=\\\\{s\\_{1},s\\_{2},...\\\\}.\nFor example, the constituent structure in the top right of Figure [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S1.F1 \"Figure 1 ‚Ä£ 1 Introduction ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") can be represented as {{\\\\{‚Äúa theory‚Äù, ‚Äúuntil late night‚Äù,‚Ä¶}}\\\\}.\nPrevious research evaluates unsupervised constituency parsers using sentence-F1, the F1 score computed from the string collection representing the predicted structure and the collection representing the gold structure (Shen et al., [2017](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib27 \"\")).\n\nProbability-Weighted Information (PWI) (Aizawa, [2003](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib1 \"\")) is fundamental to our SemInfo estimation method.\nPWI provides an information-theoretic interpretation of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) statistics calculated in Bag-of-Words (BoW) models.\nLet ùíüùíü{\\\\mathcal{D}} denote a document corpus, disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i} the iùëñi-th document in the corpus, and wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij} the jùëój-th word in disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i}.\nThe BoW model represents the document disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i} as an unordered collection of words occurring in the document (i.e., di={wi‚Äã1,wi‚Äã2,‚Ä¶}subscriptùëëùëñsubscriptùë§ùëñ1subscriptùë§ùëñ2‚Ä¶d\\_{i}=\\\\{w\\_{i1},w\\_{i2},...\\\\}).\nTf-idf, as shown in Equation [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S2.E1 \"In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\"), is the product of the term frequency F‚Äã(wi‚Äãj,di)ùêπsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñF(w\\_{ij},d\\_{i}) (i.e. the frequency of wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij} occurring in disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i}) and the inverse document frequency (i.e. the inverse log-frequency of documents containing wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij}).\nTf-idf is an important feature in finding keywords in documents (Li et al., [2007](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib19 \"\")) or in efficiently locating documents based on the given keyword (Mishra & Vishwakarma, [2015](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib23 \"\")).\nPWI interprets the term frequency as the word generation probability and the inverse document frequency as the piecewise word-document information (Equation [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S2.E2 \"In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\")).\nIntuitively, a word with a high tf-idf value suggests that it carries a significant amount of information about the document (i.e., a keyword of the document).\nAizawa ( [2003](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib1 \"\")) further interpret scaling or smoothing of the term frequency as variations in estimating P‚Äã(wi‚Äãj\\|di)ùëÉconditionalsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñP(w\\_{ij}\\|d\\_{i}).\n\n|     |     |     |     |

unsupervised constituency parsers (Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\"); Yang et al., [2021a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib38 \"\")).\nThis method trains a binary PCFG parser over a text corpus by maximizing the average LL of the corpus.\nA PCFG is a generative model defined by a tuple (N‚ÄãT,T,R,S,œÄ)ùëÅùëáùëáùëÖùëÜùúã(NT,T,R,S,\\\\pi), where N‚ÄãTùëÅùëáNT is the set of non-terminal symbols, TùëáT is the set of terminal symbols, RùëÖR is the set of production rules, SùëÜS is the start symbol, and œÄùúã\\\\pi is the probability distribution over the rules.\nThe generation process starts with the start symbol SùëÜS and iteratively applies non-terminal expansion rules (A‚ÜíB‚ÄãC:A,B,C‚ààN‚ÄãT:‚Üíùê¥ùêµùê∂ùê¥ùêµùê∂ùëÅùëáA\\\\rightarrow BC:A,B,C\\\\in NT) or terminal rewriting rules (A‚Üíw:A‚ààN‚ÄãT,w‚ààT:‚Üíùê¥ùë§formulae-sequenceùê¥ùëÅùëáùë§ùëáA\\\\rightarrow w:A\\\\in NT,w\\\\in T) until it produces a complete sentence xùë•x.\nWe can represent the generation process with a tree-shaped structure tùë°t.\nThe PCFG assigns a probability for each distinct way of generating xùë•x, defining a distribution P‚Äã(x,t)ùëÉùë•ùë°P(x,t).\nThe Inside-Outside algorithm (Baker, [1979](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib2 \"\")) provides an efficient solution for computing the total sentence probability P‚Äã(x)=‚àëtP‚Äã(x,t)ùëÉùë•subscriptùë°ùëÉùë•ùë°P(x)=\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\_{t}P(x,t).\nThe algorithm constructs a Œ≤‚Äã(s,A)ùõΩùë†ùê¥\\\\beta(s,A) table that records the total probability of generating a substring sùë†s of xùë•x from the non-terminal Aùê¥A.\nThe sentence probability can be calculated as P‚Äã(x)=Œ≤‚Äã(x,S)ùëÉùë•ùõΩùë•ùëÜP(x)=\\\\beta(x,S), the probability of xùë•x being generated from the start symbol SùëÜS.\nThe Œ≤‚Äã(x,S)ùõΩùë•ùëÜ\\\\beta(x,S) quantity is commonly referred to as Z‚Äã(X)ùëçùëãZ(X)(Eisner, [2016](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib11 \"\")).\nBesides the total sentence probability, the Œ≤ùõΩ\\\\beta table can also be used to calculate the span-posterior probability of sùë†s being a constituent (Eisner, [2016](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib11 \"\")) (Equation [3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S2.E3 \"In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\")).111We explain the derivation in more detail in Section [A.1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.SS1 \"A.1 Computing Span-posterior probability via

al., [2019b](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib17 \"\"); Stern et al., [2017](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib34 \"\")) to model the parser distribution P‚Äã(t\\|x)ùëÉconditionalùë°ùë•P(t\\|x), the probability of constituent structure tùë°t given xùë•x.\nThe span-based TreeCRF model determines the probability of tùë°t by evaluating whether all substrings involved in the structure are constituents.\nThe TreeCRF model will assign a high score to a substring sùë†s in its potential function œï‚Äã(s,x)italic-œïùë†ùë•\\\\phi(s,x) if sùë†s is likely a constituent.\nSubsequently, the TreeCRF model can represent the parser distribution as P‚Äã(t\\|x)‚àù‚àës‚ààtœï‚Äã(s,x)proportional-toùëÉconditionalùë°ùë•subscriptùë†ùë°italic-œïùë†ùë•P(t\\|x)\\\\propto\\\\sum\\_{s\\\\in t}\\\\phi(s,x).\nUsing the TreeCRF framework, we can interpret the Tree Minimum Bayesian Risk (TreeMBR) decoding of PCFG (Yang et al., [2021b](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib39 \"\")) as a Viterbi decoding of a TreeCRF model.\nIn this interpretation, the TreeCRF model uses the substring‚Äôs span-posterior probability as its potential value (i.e., œï‚Äã(s,x)=P‚Äã(s‚Äã is a constituent\\|x)italic-œïùë†ùë•ùëÉconditionalùë† is a constituentùë•\\\\phi(s,x)=P(s\\\\text{ is a constituent}\\|x)).\nIntuitively, the more likely a substring is a constituent, the more likely the TreeCRF model will generate a structure including the substring as a constituent.\nConsequently, the parser distribution derived from the TreeMBR decoding algorithm is defined as follows.\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |

section, we introduce our estimation method of SemInfo, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics.\nWe first introduce a bag-of-substrings model, representing the semantics of a sentence by examining whether substrings of the sentence would be _regenerated_ during a paraphrasing process.\nWe then apply the PWI (Aizawa, [2003](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib1 \"\")) metric to measure the substring-semantics information.\nFor a given constituent structure, we estimate its SemInfo value by aggregating the substring-semantics information associated with the structure.\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558/assets/x2.png)Figure 2: Bag-of-Substrings model derived from a paraphrasing model\n\nOur bag-of-substrings model is based on the

Metric of Information between Constituent Structures and Semantics ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nThe paraphrasing model takes a source sentence xùë•x as input, internally analyzes its semantics S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x), and generates a paraphrase xpsuperscriptùë•ùëùx^{p}.\nWe can repeatedly sample from the process, collecting a paraphrase set ùïèp={x1p,x2p,‚Ä¶}superscriptùïèùëùsubscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëù1subscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëù2‚Ä¶{\\\\mathbb{X}}^{p}=\\\\{x^{p}\\_{1},x^{p}\\_{2},...\\\\}.\nTo estimate the semantic information for substrings of xùë•x, we examine how often these substrings are regenerated by the paraphrasing model.\nSpecifically, if a substring sùë†s from xùë•x is regenerated in any paraphrase xipsubscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëùùëñx^{p}\\_{i}, we consider sùë†s to be generated by S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x).\nWe then define a bag-of-substrings representation of S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x) by aggregating the regeneration observations across ùïèpsuperscriptùïèùëù{\\\\mathbb{X}}^{p}.\n\nWe apply the PWI metric to quantify the substring-semantics information I‚Äã(s,S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x))ùêºùë†ùëÜùëíùëöùë•I(s,Sem(x)) between sùë†s and S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x), leveraging the similarity between our bag-of-substrings model and the traditional bag-of-words model.\nTo facilitate the PWI calculation (Equation [5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S3.E5 \"In 3 SemInfo: A Metric of Information between Constituent Structures and

among paraphrases ùïèpsuperscriptùïèùëù{\\\\mathbb{X}}^{p} will yield a misleading estimate of P‚Äã(s\\|S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x))ùëÉconditionalùë†ùëÜùëíùëöùë•P(s\\|Sem(x)), the probability of sùë†s being generated to carry information of S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x).\nThe reason is that one substring can be nested in another substring.\nIf a substring sùë†s is generated to convey semantic information, we will observe an occurrence of sùë†s along with an occurrence of all its substrings.\nHence, the naive substring frequency will wrongly count substring occurrences caused by the generation of larger substrings as occurrences caused by P‚Äã(s\\|S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x))ùëÉconditionalùë†ùëÜùëíùëöùë•P(s\\|Sem(x)).\nLet‚Äôs consider the example illustrated in Figure

‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nAll three substrings in the example have a frequency of 2, yet only the first substring carries significant semantic information.\nThis is because the occurrence of the first substring causes the occurrence of the second and third substrings.\nThe true frequency of the second and third substrings should be 0 instead of 2.\n\nWe introduce the notion of maximal substring to counter this problem.\nGiven a source sentence xùë•x and a paraphrase xipsubscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëùùëñx^{p}\\_{i}, the maximal substring between the two is defined in Equation [6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S3.E6 \"In 3.1 Defining ùëÉ‚Å¢(ùë†|ùëÜ‚Å¢ùëí‚Å¢ùëö‚Å¢(ùë•)) and

the three insignificant results are due to the high score variance of the LL-trained PCFGs.\nThe significant improvement demonstrates the benefit of the SemInfo maximization objective in the unsupervised constituency parsing task.\nThe result also confirms the importance of semantic factors in identifying the syntactic constituent structure.\n\nTable [1](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.T1 \"Table 1 ‚Ä£ 5.2 SemInfo Maximization Significantly Improves Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") also compares the SemInfo trained PCFG with two baseline parsers: the Maximum Tree Decoding (MTD) parser that predicts the constituent structure by finding the structure with maximum SemInfo value, and the GPT4o-mini parser that asks the GPT4o-mini model to directly predict the constituent structure.\nAmong the two baselines, we see that the MTD parser has significantly higher sentence-F1 scores than the GPT4o-mini parser across the four languages.\nThe accuracy gap indicates that SemInfo is discovering non-trivial information about the constituent structure.\nComparing the SemInfo-trained PCFG and the MTD parser, we see that all SemInfo-trained PCFG variants outperform the MTD parser in English, Chinese, and French.\nThe accuracy improvement indicates that the constituent information provided by the SemInfo value is noisy, and the grammar learns to mitigate the noises.\nIn German, SemInfo-trained PCFGs perform worse than the MTD parser.\nOne possible reason is that the German validation/testing set has a significantly different word vocabulary compared to the training set, unlike the datasets in the other three languages.\nThis shift in word distribution might be a significant factor in German PCFGs‚Äô poor parsing accuracy.\n\n### 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1\n\nIn this section, we evaluate two aspects of the SemInfo and LL functions: 1) Whether the function can accurately evaluate the model‚Äôs prediction. 2) Whether the function can approximately rank models in accordance with their performance.\nWe evaluate the two aspects using Spearman correlation (Spearman, [1904](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib31 \"\")), examining whether the objective function can rank good predictions/models higher than the bad ones.\nWe evaluate the prediction ranking capability using a sentence-level correlation and the model ranking capability using a corpus-level correlation.\n\n#### 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy\n\nThe sentence-level correlation assesses the objective function‚Äôs capability to evaluate the model prediction accurately.\nWe independently train eight _identical_ PCFG models using the LL maximization objective.\nEach model is trained with a unique random seed for 30k steps.\nFor every sentence, the eight models produce eight (sentence-F1, SemInfo, LL) tuples, which we use to calculate the sentence-level Spearman correlation coefficient.\n\nFigure [4](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.F4 \"Figure 4 ‚Ä£ 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") illustrates the SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation and the LL-sentence-F1 correlation using a random sentence in the English validation set.\nWe observed a strong positive correlation for the (SemInfo, sentence-F1) pairs but observed no positive correlation for the (LL, sentence-F1) pairs.\nTable [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.T2 \"Table 2 ‚Ä£ 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") demonstrates the correlation in a more statistically reliable way.\nWe perform mean-aggregation on the sentence-level correlation coefficient using Fisher‚Äôs Z transformation (Fisher, [1915](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib12 \"\")).\nFisher‚Äôs Z transformation converts the correlation coefficient to a uni-variance space, reducing the negative impact caused by the skewness in the coefficient‚Äôs distribution(Silver & Dunlap, [1987](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib29 \"\")).\nThe aggregated coefficients for the SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation range from 0.6-0.9, whereas the aggregated coefficients for the LL-sentence-F1 correlation center around 0.\nWe can consistently observe the correlation coefficient gap in different stages of training, as discussed in Appendix [A.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.SS2 \"A.2 Sentence-level Correlation in different training stages ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nThis sentence-level correlation analysis demonstrates a strong positive correlation between SemInfo and sentence-F1, while identifying no apparent correlation between LL and sentence-F1.\nThe high SemInfo-sentence-F1 coefficient indicates that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric of parsing accuracy.\nThe gap in correlation coefficients suggests that SemInfo might be a better objective function for unsupervised constituency parsing than LL.\n\nSemInfo-SF1LL-SF1SemInfo-LLCPCFG0.65180.02230.0196NPCFG0.6347-0.0074-0.0045SCPCFG0.6431-0.00130.0505SNPCFG0.92890.01020.0182TNPCFG0.64490.10770.1426Table 2: Spearman correlation coefficient

The values are measured on a random sentence from the English validation set.\n\n#### 5.3.2 SemInfo Ranks PCFG Models Better Than LL\n\nThe corpus-level correlation evaluates the objective functions‚Äô capability to rank models in accordance with their performance.\nWe examine the correlation using model checkpoints collected over different training stages of the above eight PCFG models.\nEach stage is represented by a window over the amount of training steps.\nFor example, a stage \\[1k, 10k\\] contains checkpoints from 1k to 10k steps.\nThese checkpoints produce corpus-level sentence-F1 scores, average SemInfo values, and average LL values, which we use to calculate the corpus-level coefficient at that training stage.\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558/assets/figures/sw_corr.png)Figure 5: Spearman œÅùúå\\\\rho with sentence-F1 (denoted as SF1) in different training stages of NPCFG.\n\nFigure [5](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.F5 \"Figure 5 ‚Ä£ 5.3.2 SemInfo Ranks PCFG Models Better Than LL ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") illustrates the SemInfo-sentence-F1 and LL-sentence-F1 correlation curves for NPCFG.444We include the correlation curve for the other four PCFG variants in Appendix [A.3](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.SS3 \"A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nWe can observe that LL does have a strong corpus-level correlation with sentence-F1 at the early stage of training despite having a near-non-existent sentence-level correlation.\nHowever, the strength of the corpus-level correlation diminishes quickly, dropping below 0.4 at the late training stage.\nThis result indicates that LL is able to identify a reasonable PCFG model among a set of poorly performing models in the early training stage, but such ability quickly degrades as the training goes on.\nIn comparison, SemInfo maintains a strong correlation across the whole training process, which indicates SemInfo‚Äôs superior capability in ranking PCFG models by their performance.\n\nIn summary, the two correlation analyses provide an empirical explanation for SemInfo‚Äôs success in improving PCFG induction.\nThe analyses demonstrate that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric for parsing accuracy and that SemInfo can rank PCFG models better than LL.\nThe strong SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation also underscores the usefulness of semantic factors in identifying the syntactic constituent structure.\n\n### 5.4 Comparing with State-Of-The-Arts\n\nEnglishChineseFrenchGermanNPCFG (60NT)63.62¬±1.0753.92¬±0.4851.88¬±0.7347.77¬±0.26SCPCFG (1024NT)66.92¬±0.7652.26¬±0.4152.29¬±0.5345.32¬±0.67SNPCFG (1024NT)66.84¬±0.5352.04¬±0.9354.37¬±0.1047.27¬±0.16Spanoverlap (Chen et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib9 \"\"))52.948.748.549.5SCPCFG (2048NT) (Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\"))60.642.949.949.1SNPCFG (4096NT) (Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\"))65.139.93846.7URNNG (Kim et al., [2019b](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib17 \"\"))40.729.1--NBL-PCFG (Yang et al., [2021a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib38 \"\"))60.4---S-DIORA (Xu et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib37 \"\"))57.6---StructFormer (Shen et al., [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib28 \"\"))54---Constituency Test (Cao et al., [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib5 \"\"))62.8---\n\nTable 3: Sentence-F1 on English, Chinese, French, and German test sets.

( [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\")).\nThe comparison showcases the strong parsing accuracy of the SemInfo-trained PCFGs, confirming the usefulness of semantic information in discovering the constituent structure.\n\n## 6 Related works\n\nParsing with Substring Frequency To the best of our knowledge, Chen et al. ( [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib9 \"\")) first found that the substring frequency calculated among paraphrases can be used to identify constituent structures.\nWe extend their findings, establishing a connection between semantic information and the frequency statistic.\nWe interpret the substring frequency as a term in the substring-semantics information and apply the substring-semantics information to improve PCFG induction.\nOur method significantly outperforms theirs in three out of the four languages tested.\n\nParsing with PCFG\nPCFG induction is a long-established (Klein & Manning, [2002](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib18 \"\")) and state-of-the-art (Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\")) approach for non-ensemble unsupervised constituency parsing.\nMuch research has dedicated to improving PCFG induction from the model perspective, such as scaling up the PCFG model (Yang et al., [2021b](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib39 \"\"); Liu et al., [2023](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib20 \"\")), integrating lexical information (Yang et al., [2021a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib38 \"\")), and allowing PCFG rule probabilities to condition on sentence embeddings through variational inferences (Kim et al., [2019a](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib16 \"\")).\nOur improvement is from the model optimization perspective and can be combined with the above efforts.\nOur experiments validate the effectiveness of the SemInfo maximization objective in improving unlexicalized PCFGs.\nThe SemInfo maximization objective is also applicable to lexicalized PCFGs, which we leave to future work.\n\nParsing with SemanticsZhao & Titov ( [2020](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib41 \"\")) and Zhang et al. ( [2021](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib40 \"\")) have sought to improve PCFG induction by learning to identify visual features, maximizing the association between constituent structures and these visual features.\nIf we consider the visual features as semantic representations, their approach is effectively maximizing the semantic information of the constituent structure.\nIn comparison, our method shares the same underlying principle but represents the semantics with textual features.\nOur method leverages large language models as semantic processors, utilizing their outstanding semantic processing capabilities (Minaee et al., [2024](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#bib.bib22 \"\")).\nWe believe that combining both textual and visual semantic representations presents a significant research direction for unsupervised parsing tasks.\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed and validated a novel objective for unsupervised constituency parsing: maximizing the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics (SemInfo).\nWe developed a bag-of-substrings model to represent the semantics and applied the probability-weighted information metric to estimate the SemInfo.\nWe applied the SemInfo maximization objective by maximizing the expected SemInfo for a PCFG-based TreeCRF parser.\nExperiments showed that SemInfo has a strong sentence-level correlation with sentence-F1 and that SemInfo maintains a consistent corpus-level correlation throughout the PCFG training process.\nThe strong sentence-level correlation indicates that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric of parsing accuracy.\nThe consistent corpus-level correlation indicates that SemInfo can serve as a reliable training objective for unsupervised parsing.\nAs a result, SemInfo-trained PCFGs significantly outperformed LL-trained PCFGs across four languages and achieved new state-of-the-art results in three of them.\nOur findings underscore the effectiveness of leveraging semantic information in unsupervised constituency parsing, paving the way for accurate semantically-informed unsupervised parsing methods.\n\n## References\n\n- Aizawa (2003)\nAkiko Aizawa.\n\nAn information-theoretic perspective of tf‚Äìidf measures.\n\n_Information Processing & Management_, 39(1):45‚Äì65, January 2003.\n\nISSN 03064573.\n\ndoi: 10.1016/S0306-4573(02)00021-3.\n\nURL [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306457302000213](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306457302000213 \"\").\n\n- Baker (1979)\nJ.

Sentence-level Spearman correlations for models trained for 10k steps, 20k steps, and 30k steps.\n\nIn Table [2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.T2 \"Table 2 ‚Ä£ 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\"), we showed a strong sentence-level correlation between SemInfo and sentence-F1 but a weak correlation between LL and sentence-F1.\nNevertheless, the question of whether the correlation gap is related to the number of training steps remains.\nFigure [6](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.F6 \"Figure 6 ‚Ä£ A.2 Sentence-level Correlation in different training stages ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") excludes the number of training steps as a factor in the correlation gap.\nIn this experiment, we calculate the correlation coefficient for models trained for 10k steps, 20k steps, and 30k steps.\nWe can observe that, for all PCFG variants, the correlation coefficients for (SemInfo, sentence-F1) are consistently over 0.6, while the coefficients for (LL, sentence-F1) are consistently below 0.1.\nThis result underscores our conclusion that SemInfo can serve as an accurate of parsing accuracy.\n\n### A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation\n\n![Refer to caption](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558/assets/figures/corpus_level-corr_plot.png)Figure 7: Corpus-level Spearman correlation in different training stages.\n\nFigure [7](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.F7 \"Figure 7 ‚Ä£ A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") shows the corpus-level correlation in different training stages for all five PCFG variants.\nWe observe the same phenomenon explained in Section [5.3.2](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#S5.SS3.SSS2 \"5.3.2 SemInfo Ranks PCFG Models Better Than LL ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") for CPCFG, NPCFG, SNPCFG, and TNPCFG.\nThe correlation coefficients for (SemInfo, Sentence-F1) are consistently above 0.75, whereas the coefficients for (LL, Sentence-F1) drop quickly as the training progresses.\nWe can observe the stronger correlation between SemInfo and sentence-F1 in Figure [8](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.F8 \"Figure 8 ‚Ä£ A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nThe figure plots the training curves of the corpus-level sentence-F1 score, the average SemInfo value, and the average LL value over the English validation set.\nFor example, we can see that SemInfo ranks the NPCFG models represented by the green and grey lines as the lowest, and those represented by the purple and blue lines as the highest.\nThis largely agrees with the sentence-F1 scores, where the NPCFG models represented by the green and grey lines are among the bottom three worst-performing models, and the models represented by the blue and purple lines are among the top three best-performing models.\nIn comparison, we see that all models have similar LL scores, which indicates LL‚Äôs inability to rank models in accordance with their parsing performance.\nThese results underscore our conclusion that SemInfo ranks PCFG models better than LL.\n\nIn Figure [7](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.F7 \"Figure 7 ‚Ä£ A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\"), we observe that the correlation strength for (SemInfo, Sentence-F1) also drops as training processes in SCPCFG.\nOne reason is that SCPCFG failed to explore constituent structures with high SemInfo values.\nAs shown in Figure [8](https://ar5iv.org/html/2410.02558#A1.F8 \"Figure 8 ‚Ä£ A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\"), the average SemInfo value across the eight models is around 42 for SCPCFG, while the average SemInfo value is greater or equal to 45 for the other four PCFG variants.\nThis result indicates that the constituent information provided in low SemInfo regions might contain more noise than the information provided in high SemInfo regions.\n\n![Refer to

    "1 Introduction": {
      "content": "Unsupervised constituency parsing is a syntactic task of organizing phrases of a sentence into a tree-shaped and unlabelled constituent structure without relying on any linguistic annotations (Klein & Manning, [2002]).\nThe constituent structure is a fundamental tool in analyzing sentence semantics (i.e., the meaning) (Carnie, [2007]; Steedman, [2000]) and can significantly improve performance for downstream Natural Language Processing systems, such as natural language inference (He et al., [2020]), machine translation (Xie & Xing, [2017]) and semantic role labeling (Chen et al., [2022]).\nEach constituent in the structure corresponds to a meaningful substring in the sentence, which guides us to progressively construct the sentence semantics.\nFigure [1]Figure 1 ‚Ä£ 1 Introduction ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") illustrates the progressive semantic construction of the sentence ‚ÄúJohn has been working on a theory until late night‚Äù.\nThis example demonstrates that _constituent substrings in the sentence carry significant semantic information_, illustrating an alignment between syntax and semantics.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 1: An illustration of the progressive semantics build-up in accordance with the constituent structure. The tree structure in the top-right shows the simplified constituent structure for illustration purposes. Constituent strings are highlighted in blue.\n\nMaximizing sentence log-likelihood has traditionally been the primary training objective for unsupervised constituency parsers (Eisner, [2016]; Kim et al., [2019a]).\nHowever, Log-Likelihood (LL), the objective function, does not explicitly factor in the syntax-semantics alignment.\nThis leads to a poor correlation between the LL value and the parsing accuracy, which we will discuss further in Section [5.3]SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nAs pointed out in previous research, training a Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) parser that outperforms trivial baselines with the LL maximization objective is challenging (Carroll & Charniak, [1992]; Kim et al., [2019a]).\nSuccessful training commonly involves altering the LL maximization objective, such as imposing sparsity constraints (Cohen et al., [2008]; Johnson et al., [2007]) or heuristically estimating the LL value (Spitkovsky et al., [2010]).\nEvidence suggests that the LL function might not provide robust information to distinguish between constituents and non-constituents, rendering LL an insufficient objective function for unsupervised parsing.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel objective for unsupervised constituency parsing: maximizing the semantic information that constituent structures carry.\nWe propose a novel method for measuring _SemInfo_, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics.\nSpecifically, we introduce a bag-of-substrings model to represent the sentence semantics and quantify semantic information encoded in each substring using the probability-weighted information metric developed for bag-of-words models (Aizawa, [2003]).\nWe calculate the SemInfo value by aggregating the substring-semantic information associated with the constituent structure.\nExperiments show a much stronger correlation between SemInfo and the parsing accuracy than the correlation between LL and the parsing accuracy, suggesting that SemInfo is an effective objective function for unsupervised constituency parsing.\nIn addition, we develop a Tree Conditional Random Field (TreeCRF)-based model to apply the SemInfo maximization objective to PCFG induction, the state-of-the-art method for unsupervised constituency parsing.\nExperiments demonstrate that the SemInfo maximization objective improves the PCFG‚Äôs parsing accuracy by 7.85 points across five latest PCFG variants and in four languages.\n\nOur main contributions are: (1) Proposing a novel method for estimating SemInfo, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics. (2) Demonstrating a strong correlation between SemInfo values and parsing accuracy. (3) Developing a TreeCRF model to apply the SemInfo maximization objective to PCFG induction, significantly improving parsing accuracy and setting new state-of-the-art results in three of the four languages tested.",

      "content": "The idea that constituent structures reflect the organization of sentence semantics is central to modern linguistic studies (Steedman, [2000]; Pollard & Sag, [1987]).\nA constituent is a substring sùë†s in a sentence xùë•x that can function independently (Carnie, [2007]) and carries individual meaning (Heim & Kratzer, [1998]).\nA collection of constituents forms a tree-shaped structure tùë°t, which we can represent as a collection of its constituent strings t={s1,s2,‚Ä¶}ùë°subscriptùë†1subscriptùë†2‚Ä¶t=\\\\{s\\_{1},s\\_{2},...\\\\}.\nFor example, the constituent structure in the top right of Figure [1]Figure 1 ‚Ä£ 1 Introduction ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") can be represented as {{\\\\{‚Äúa theory‚Äù, ‚Äúuntil late night‚Äù,‚Ä¶}}\\\\}.\nPrevious research evaluates unsupervised constituency parsers using sentence-F1, the F1 score computed from the string collection representing the predicted structure and the collection representing the gold structure (Shen et al., [2017]).\n\nProbability-Weighted Information (PWI) (Aizawa, [2003]) is fundamental to our SemInfo estimation method.\nPWI provides an information-theoretic interpretation of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) statistics calculated in Bag-of-Words (BoW) models.\nLet ùíüùíü{\\\\mathcal{D}} denote a document corpus, disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i} the iùëñi-th document in the corpus, and wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij} the jùëój-th word in disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i}.\nThe BoW model represents the document disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i} as an unordered collection of words occurring in the document (i.e., di={wi‚Äã1,wi‚Äã2,‚Ä¶}subscriptùëëùëñsubscriptùë§ùëñ1subscriptùë§ùëñ2‚Ä¶d\\_{i}=\\\\{w\\_{i1},w\\_{i2},...\\\\}).\nTf-idf, as shown in Equation [1]In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\"), is the product of the term frequency F‚Äã(wi‚Äãj,di)ùêπsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñF(w\\_{ij},d\\_{i}) (i.e. the frequency of wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij} occurring in disubscriptùëëùëñd\\_{i}) and the inverse document frequency (i.e. the inverse log-frequency of documents containing wi‚Äãjsubscriptùë§ùëñùëów\\_{ij}).\nTf-idf is an important feature in finding keywords in documents (Li et al., [2007]) or in efficiently locating documents based on the given keyword (Mishra & Vishwakarma, [2015]).\nPWI interprets the term frequency as the word generation probability and the inverse document frequency as the piecewise word-document information (Equation [2]In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\")).\nIntuitively, a word with a high tf-idf value suggests that it carries a significant amount of information about the document (i.e., a keyword of the document).\nAizawa ( [2003])) further interpret scaling or smoothing of the term frequency as variations in estimating P‚Äã(wi‚Äãj\\|di)ùëÉconditionalsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñP(w\\_{ij}\\|d\\_{i}).\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | tf-idf‚Äã(wi‚Äãj,di)tf-idfsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñ\\\\displaystyle\\\\text{tf-idf}(w\\_{ij},d\\_{i}) | =F‚Äã(wi‚Äãj,di)‚èüterm frequency√ólog‚Å°\\|ùíü\\|\\|d‚Ä≤:d‚Ä≤‚ààùíü‚àßwi‚Äãj‚ààd‚Ä≤\\|‚èüinverse document frequency\\\\displaystyle=\\\\underbrace{\\\\vphantom{\\\\left(\\\\frac{a^{0.3}}{b}\\\\right)}F(w\\_{ij},d\\_{i})}\\_{\\\\text{term frequency}}\\\\times\\\\underbrace{\\\\log\\\\frac{\\|{\\\\mathcal{D}}\\|}{\\|d^{\\\\prime}:d^{\\\\prime}\\\\in{\\\\mathcal{D}}\\\\wedge w\\_{ij}\\\\in d^{\\\\prime}\\|}}\\_{\\\\text{inverse document frequency}} |  | (1) |\n|  |  | ‚âàP‚Äã(wi‚Äãj\\|di)‚èüword generation probability√ólog‚Å°P‚Äã(di\\|wi‚Äãj)P‚Äã(di)‚èüpiecewise word-document informationabsentsubscript‚èüùëÉconditionalsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñword generation probabilitysubscript‚èüùëÉconditionalsubscriptùëëùëñsubscriptùë§ùëñùëóùëÉsubscriptùëëùëñpiecewise word-document information\\\\displaystyle\\\\approx\\\\underbrace{\\\\vphantom{\\\\left(\\\\frac{a^{0.3}}{b}\\\\right)}P(w\\_{ij}\\|d\\_{i})}\\_{\\\\text{word generation probability}}\\\\times\\\\underbrace{\\\\log\\\\frac{P(d\\_{i}\\|w\\_{ij})}{P(d\\_{i})}}\\_{\\\\text{piecewise word-document information}} |  | (2) |\n|  |  | =P‚ÄãW‚ÄãI‚Äã(wi‚Äãj,di)absentùëÉùëäùêºsubscriptùë§ùëñùëósubscriptùëëùëñ\\\\displaystyle=PWI(w\\_{ij},d\\_{i}) |  |\n\nPCFG induction is currently the state-of-the-art method for training unsupervised constituency parsers (Liu et al., [2023]; Yang et al., [2021a]).\nThis method trains a binary PCFG parser over a text corpus by maximizing the average LL of the corpus.\nA PCFG is a generative model defined by a tuple (N‚ÄãT,T,R,S,œÄ)ùëÅùëáùëáùëÖùëÜùúã(NT,T,R,S,\\\\pi), where N‚ÄãTùëÅùëáNT is the set of non-terminal symbols, TùëáT is the set of terminal symbols, RùëÖR is the set of production rules, SùëÜS is the start symbol, and œÄùúã\\\\pi is the probability distribution over the rules.\nThe generation process starts with the start symbol SùëÜS and iteratively applies non-terminal expansion rules (A‚ÜíB‚ÄãC:A,B,C‚ààN‚ÄãT:‚Üíùê¥ùêµùê∂ùê¥ùêµùê∂ùëÅùëáA\\\\rightarrow BC:A,B,C\\\\in NT) or terminal rewriting rules (A‚Üíw:A‚ààN‚ÄãT,w‚ààT:‚Üíùê¥ùë§formulae-sequenceùê¥ùëÅùëáùë§ùëáA\\\\rightarrow w:A\\\\in NT,w\\\\in T) until it produces a complete sentence xùë•x.\nWe can represent the generation process with a tree-shaped structure tùë°t.\nThe PCFG assigns a probability for each distinct way of generating xùë•x, defining a distribution P‚Äã(x,t)ùëÉùë•ùë°P(x,t).\nThe Inside-Outside algorithm (Baker, [1979]) provides an efficient solution for computing the total sentence probability P‚Äã(x)=‚àëtP‚Äã(x,t)ùëÉùë•subscriptùë°ùëÉùë•ùë°P(x)=\\\\mathop{\\\\sum}\\_{t}P(x,t).\nThe algorithm constructs a Œ≤‚Äã(s,A)ùõΩùë†ùê¥\\\\beta(s,A) table that records the total probability of generating a substring sùë†s of xùë•x from the non-terminal Aùê¥A.\nThe sentence probability can be calculated as P‚Äã(x)=Œ≤‚Äã(x,S)ùëÉùë•ùõΩùë•ùëÜP(x)=\\\\beta(x,S), the probability of xùë•x being generated from the start symbol SùëÜS.\nThe Œ≤‚Äã(x,S)ùõΩùë•ùëÜ\\\\beta(x,S) quantity is commonly referred to as Z‚Äã(X)ùëçùëãZ(X)(Eisner, [2016]).\nBesides the total sentence probability, the Œ≤ùõΩ\\\\beta table can also be used to calculate the span-posterior probability of sùë†s being a constituent (Eisner, [2016]) (Equation [3]In 2 Background ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\")).111We explain the derivation in more detail in Section [A.1]A.1 Computing Span-posterior probability via back-propagation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\n\n|     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | P‚Äã(s‚Äã is a constituent\\|x)=‚àëA‚ààN‚ÄãT‚àÇlog‚Å°Z‚Äã(x)‚àÇlog‚Å°Œ≤‚Äã(s,A)ùëÉconditionalùë† is a constituentùë•subscriptùê¥ùëÅùëáùëçùë•ùõΩùë†ùê¥P(s\\\\text{ is a constituent}\\|x)=\\\\sum\\_{A\\\\in NT}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\log Z(x)}{\\\\partial\\\\log\\\\beta(s,A)} |  | (3) |\n\nSpan-based TreeCRF models are widely adopted in constituency parsers (Kim et al., [2019b];

      "content": "In this section, we introduce our estimation method of SemInfo, the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics.\nWe first introduce a bag-of-substrings model, representing the semantics of a sentence by examining whether substrings of the sentence would be _regenerated_ during a paraphrasing process.\nWe then apply the PWI (Aizawa, [2003]) metric to measure the substring-semantics information.\nFor a given constituent structure, we estimate its SemInfo value by aggregating the substring-semantics information associated with the structure.\n\n![Refer to

S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x), and generates a paraphrase xpsuperscriptùë•ùëùx^{p}.\nWe can repeatedly sample from the process, collecting a paraphrase set

substrings of xùë•x, we examine how often these substrings are regenerated by the paraphrasing model.\nSpecifically, if a substring sùë†s from xùë•x is regenerated in any paraphrase

effective empirical estimator of distributions.\nHowever, naively measuring substring frequency among paraphrases ùïèpsuperscriptùïèùëù{\\\\mathbb{X}}^{p} will yield a misleading estimate of P‚Äã(s\\|S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x))ùëÉconditionalùë†ùëÜùëíùëöùë•P(s\\|Sem(x)), the probability of sùë†s being generated to carry information of S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x)ùëÜùëíùëöùë•Sem(x).\nThe reason is that one substring can be nested in another substring.\nIf a substring sùë†s is generated to convey semantic information, we will observe an occurrence of sùë†s along with an occurrence of all its substrings.\nHence, the naive substring frequency will wrongly count substring occurrences caused by the generation of larger substrings as occurrences caused by P‚Äã(s\\|S‚Äãe‚Äãm‚Äã(x))ùëÉconditionalùë†ùëÜùëíùëöùë•P(s\\|Sem(x)).\nLet‚Äôs consider the example illustrated in Figure [3]Figure 3 ‚Ä£ 3.1 Defining ùëÉ‚Å¢(ùë†|ùëÜ‚Å¢ùëí‚Å¢ùëö‚Å¢(ùë•))

significant semantic information.\nThis is because the occurrence of the first substring causes the occurrence of the second and third substrings.\nThe true frequency of the second and third substrings should be 0 instead of 2.\n\nWe introduce the notion of maximal substring to counter this problem.\nGiven a source sentence xùë•x and a paraphrase xipsubscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëùùëñx^{p}\\_{i}, the maximal substring between the two is defined in Equation [6]In 3.1 Defining ùëÉ‚Å¢(ùë†|ùëÜ‚Å¢ùëí‚Å¢ùëö‚Å¢(ùë•)) and

xipsubscriptsuperscriptùë•ùëùùëñx^{p}\\_{i}.\nFormally, we denote the partial order relationship of string Œ±ùõº\\\\alpha being a substring in string Œ≤ùõΩ\\\\beta by

( [2021b]) and Liu et al. ( [2023])\nSNPCFG and SCPCFG represent the current state-of-the-art for non-ensemble unsupervised constituency parsing.\nWe use 60 NTs for NPCFG and CPCFG, and 1024 NTs for TNPCFG, SNPCFG, and SCPCFG in our experiment.\nWe conduct the evaluations in four languages, namely English, Chinese, German, and French, as Liu et al. ( [2023]) did previously.\nWe use the Penn TreeBank (PTB) (Marcus et al., [1999]) for the English evaluation, the Chinese Treebank 5.1 (CTB) (Palmer et al., [2005]) for the Chinese evaluation, and the SPMRL dataset (Seddah et al., [2013]) for the German and French evaluation.\nWe adopt the standard data split for the PTB dataset,\nusing Sections 02-21 for training, Section 22 for validation, and Section 23 for testing (Kim et al., [2019a]).\nWe adopt the official data split for the CTB and SPMRL datasets.\n\nFollowing Shen et al. ( [2017]), we train the PCFG induction model on raw text and evaluate its parsing performance using corpus-level sentence-F1 scores.\nThe corpus-level score is computed by averaging the sentence-F1 score across the entire corpus.\nWe evaluate the sentence-F1 score for sentences longer than two words and drop punctuation and trivial spans (i.e., sentence-level spans and spans with only one word).\n\nFollowing Chen et al. ( [2024]), we use the gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 model as our paraphrasing model to facilitate multilingual experiments and apply normalization to the source sentence and the paraphrases.\nWe use eight semantic-preserving prompts for the paraphrasing model.333Detailed prompts are listed in Section [A.5]A.5 Paraphrasing prompts ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\")\nWe apply the snowball stemmer (Bird & Loper, [2004]) to normalize the source sentence and its paraphrases before calculating the maximal substring frequency and the inverse document frequency.\nWe apply the log-normalization (Sparck Jones, [1972]) to the maximal substring frequency to avoid some high-frequency substrings dominating the SemInfo value.\nWe found that the log-normalization variant performs marginally but consistently better than the unnormalized variant in our preliminary experiment.\nThe application of log-normalization is aligned with the theoretical framework of Aizawa ( [2003])).\n\n### 5.2 SemInfo Maximization Significantly Improves Parsing Accuracy\n\nEnglishChineseFrenchGermanSemInfo (Ours)LLSemInfoLLSemInfoLLSemInfoLLCPCFG65.74¬±0.8153.75¬±0.8150.39¬±0.8751.45¬±0.4952.15¬±0.7547.50¬±0.4149.80¬±0.3145.64¬±0.73NPCFG64.45¬±1.1350.96¬±1.8253.30¬±0.4242.12¬±3.0752.36¬±0.6247.95¬±0.0950.74¬±0.2845.85¬±0.63SCPCFG67.27¬±1.0849.42¬±2.4251.76¬±0.5446.20¬±3.6552.79¬±0.8045.03¬±0.4247.97¬±0.7645.50¬±0.71SNPCFG67.15¬±0.6258.19¬±1.1351.55¬±0.8243.79¬±0.3955.21¬±0.4749.64¬±0.9149.65¬±0.2940.51¬±1.26TNPCFG66.55¬±0.9653.37¬±4.2851.79¬±0.8345.14¬±3.0554.11¬±0.6639.97¬±4.1049.26¬±0.6444.94¬±1.34Average ŒîŒî\\\\Delta+13.09+6.02+7.31+4.92MaxTreeDecoding58.2849.0352.0350.82GPT4o-mini36.1611.8230.0133.56\n\nTable 1: Corpus-level sentence-F1 scores of five PCFG variants trained with SemInfo and LL.

Improvements that are statistically significant (p<0.05ùëù0.05p<0.05) are highlighted in bold.\n\nTable [1]Table 1 ‚Ä£ 5.2 SemInfo Maximization Significantly Improves Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") compares SemInfo-trained PCFGs and LL-trained PCFGs for five PCFG variants and in four languages.\nFor each variant, we independently train three PCFG models on the SemInfo and LL objectives and report the mean and standard deviation of the model‚Äôs performance.\nWe can observe that the SemInfo-trained PCFGs achieve significantly higher parsing accuracy than the LL-trained PCFGs.\nThe average improvements are 13.09, 6.02, 7.31, and 4.92 sentence-F1 scores in English, Chinese, French, and German, respectively.\nTwo-tailed t-tests indicate the improvement to be statistically significant (p<<0.05) in 17 out of 20 combinations.\nTwo of the three insignificant results are due to the high score variance of the LL-trained PCFGs.\nThe significant improvement demonstrates the benefit of the SemInfo maximization objective in the unsupervised constituency parsing task.\nThe result also confirms the importance of semantic factors in identifying the syntactic constituent structure.\n\nTable [1]Table 1 ‚Ä£ 5.2 SemInfo Maximization Significantly Improves Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") also compares the SemInfo trained PCFG with two baseline parsers: the Maximum Tree Decoding (MTD) parser that predicts the constituent structure by finding the structure with maximum SemInfo value, and the GPT4o-mini parser that asks the GPT4o-mini model to directly predict the constituent structure.\nAmong the two baselines, we see that the MTD parser has significantly higher sentence-F1 scores than the GPT4o-mini parser across the four languages.\nThe accuracy gap indicates that SemInfo is discovering non-trivial information about the constituent structure.\nComparing the SemInfo-trained PCFG and the MTD parser, we see that all SemInfo-trained PCFG variants outperform the MTD parser in English, Chinese, and French.\nThe accuracy improvement indicates that the constituent information provided by the SemInfo value is noisy, and the grammar learns to mitigate the noises.\nIn German, SemInfo-trained PCFGs perform worse than the MTD parser.\nOne possible reason is that the German validation/testing set has a significantly different word vocabulary compared to the training set, unlike the datasets in the other three languages.\nThis shift in word distribution might be a significant factor in German PCFGs‚Äô poor parsing accuracy.\n\n### 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1\n\nIn this section, we evaluate two aspects of the SemInfo and LL functions: 1) Whether the function can accurately evaluate the model‚Äôs prediction. 2) Whether the function can approximately rank models in accordance with their performance.\nWe evaluate the two aspects using Spearman correlation (Spearman, [1904]), examining whether the objective function can rank good predictions/models higher than the bad ones.\nWe evaluate the prediction ranking capability using a sentence-level correlation and the model ranking capability using a corpus-level correlation.\n\n#### 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy\n\nThe sentence-level correlation assesses the objective function‚Äôs capability to evaluate the model prediction accurately.\nWe independently train eight _identical_ PCFG models using the LL maximization objective.\nEach model is trained with a unique random seed for 30k steps.\nFor every sentence, the eight models produce eight (sentence-F1, SemInfo, LL) tuples, which we use to calculate the sentence-level Spearman correlation coefficient.\n\nFigure [4]Figure 4 ‚Ä£ 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") illustrates the SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation and the LL-sentence-F1 correlation using a random sentence in the English validation set.\nWe observed a strong positive correlation for the (SemInfo, sentence-F1) pairs but observed no positive correlation for the (LL, sentence-F1) pairs.\nTable [2]Table 2 ‚Ä£ 5.3.1 SemInfo is an Accurate Metric of Parsing Accuracy ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") demonstrates the correlation in a more statistically reliable way.\nWe perform mean-aggregation on the sentence-level correlation coefficient using Fisher‚Äôs Z transformation (Fisher, [1915]).\nFisher‚Äôs Z transformation converts the correlation coefficient to a uni-variance space, reducing the negative impact caused by the skewness in the coefficient‚Äôs distribution(Silver & Dunlap, [1987]).\nThe aggregated coefficients for the SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation range from 0.6-0.9, whereas the aggregated coefficients for the LL-sentence-F1 correlation center around 0.\nWe can consistently observe the correlation coefficient gap in different stages of training, as discussed in Appendix [A.2]A.2 Sentence-level Correlation in different training stages ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nThis sentence-level correlation analysis demonstrates a strong positive correlation between SemInfo and sentence-F1, while identifying no apparent correlation between LL and sentence-F1.\nThe high SemInfo-sentence-F1 coefficient indicates that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric of parsing accuracy.\nThe gap in correlation coefficients suggests that SemInfo might be a better objective function for unsupervised constituency parsing than LL.\n\nSemInfo-SF1LL-SF1SemInfo-LLCPCFG0.65180.02230.0196NPCFG0.6347-0.0074-0.0045SCPCFG0.6431-0.00130.0505SNPCFG0.92890.01020.0182TNPCFG0.64490.10770.1426Table 2: Spearman correlation coefficient

The values are measured on a random sentence from the English validation set.\n\n#### 5.3.2 SemInfo Ranks PCFG Models Better Than LL\n\nThe corpus-level correlation evaluates the objective functions‚Äô capability to rank models in accordance with their performance.\nWe examine the correlation using model checkpoints collected over different training stages of the above eight PCFG models.\nEach stage is represented by a window over the amount of training steps.\nFor example, a stage \\[1k, 10k\\] contains checkpoints from 1k to 10k steps.\nThese checkpoints produce corpus-level sentence-F1 scores, average SemInfo values, and average LL values, which we use to calculate the corpus-level coefficient at that training stage.\n\n![Refer to caption]Figure 5: Spearman œÅùúå\\\\rho with sentence-F1 (denoted as SF1) in different training stages of NPCFG.\n\nFigure [5]Figure 5 ‚Ä£ 5.3.2 SemInfo Ranks PCFG Models Better Than LL ‚Ä£ 5.3 SemInfo Strongly Correlates with Sentence-F1 ‚Ä£ 5 Experiment ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\") illustrates the SemInfo-sentence-F1 and LL-sentence-F1 correlation curves for NPCFG.444We include the correlation curve for the other four PCFG variants in Appendix [A.3]A.3 More detailed analysis for corpus-level correlation ‚Ä£ Appendix A Appendix ‚Ä£ Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information\").\nWe can observe that LL does have a strong corpus-level correlation with sentence-F1 at the early stage of training despite having a near-non-existent sentence-level correlation.\nHowever, the strength of the corpus-level correlation diminishes quickly, dropping below 0.4 at the late training stage.\nThis result indicates that LL is able to identify a reasonable PCFG model among a set of poorly performing models in the early training stage, but such ability quickly degrades as the training goes on.\nIn comparison, SemInfo maintains a strong correlation across the whole training process, which indicates SemInfo‚Äôs superior capability in ranking PCFG models by their performance.\n\nIn summary, the two correlation analyses provide an empirical explanation for SemInfo‚Äôs success in improving PCFG induction.\nThe analyses demonstrate that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric for parsing accuracy and that SemInfo can rank PCFG models better than LL.\nThe strong SemInfo-sentence-F1 correlation also underscores the usefulness of semantic factors in identifying the syntactic constituent structure.\n\n### 5.4 Comparing with State-Of-The-Arts\n\nEnglishChineseFrenchGermanNPCFG (60NT)63.62¬±1.0753.92¬±0.4851.88¬±0.7347.77¬±0.26SCPCFG (1024NT)66.92¬±0.7652.26¬±0.4152.29¬±0.5345.32¬±0.67SNPCFG (1024NT)66.84¬±0.5352.04¬±0.9354.37¬±0.1047.27¬±0.16Spanoverlap (Chen et al., [2024])52.948.748.549.5SCPCFG (2048NT) (Liu et al., [2023])60.642.949.949.1SNPCFG (4096NT) (Liu et al., [2023])65.139.93846.7URNNG (Kim et al., [2019b])40.729.1--NBL-PCFG (Yang et al., [2021a])60.4---S-DIORA (Xu et al., [2021])57.6---StructFormer (Shen et al., [2021])54---Constituency Test (Cao et al., [2020])62.8---\n\nTable 3: Sentence-F1 on English, Chinese, French, and German test sets.

      "content": "In this paper, we proposed and validated a novel objective for unsupervised constituency parsing: maximizing the information between constituent structures and sentence semantics (SemInfo).\nWe developed a bag-of-substrings model to represent the semantics and applied the probability-weighted information metric to estimate the SemInfo.\nWe applied the SemInfo maximization objective by maximizing the expected SemInfo for a PCFG-based TreeCRF parser.\nExperiments showed that SemInfo has a strong sentence-level correlation with sentence-F1 and that SemInfo maintains a consistent corpus-level correlation throughout the PCFG training process.\nThe strong sentence-level correlation indicates that SemInfo can serve as an accurate metric of parsing accuracy.\nThe consistent corpus-level correlation indicates that SemInfo can serve as a reliable training objective for unsupervised parsing.\nAs a result, SemInfo-trained PCFGs significantly outperformed LL-trained PCFGs across four languages and achieved new state-of-the-art results in three of them.\nOur findings underscore the effectiveness of leveraging semantic information in unsupervised constituency parsing, paving the way for accurate semantically-informed unsupervised parsing methods.",
